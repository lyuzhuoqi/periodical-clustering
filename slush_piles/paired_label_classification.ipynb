While the former aspect of “end effects” has received much theoretical attention in the literature, the physical nature of end-binding, and hence its potential impact on a wide range of studies with oligomers, remains poorly known. Here, we report for the first time end-binding to DNA using a model helix-turn-helix motif, the DNA-binding domain of ETV6, as a function of DNA sequence length. Spectral analysis of ETV6 intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by singular value decomposition showed that end-binding to nonspecific fragments was negligible at >0.2 kbp and accumulated to 8% of total binding to 23-bp oligomers. The affinity for end-binding was insensitive to salt but tracked the affinity of interior binding, suggesting translocation from interior sites rather than free solution as its mechanism. As the presence of a cognate site in the 23-bp oligomer suppressed end-binding, neglect of end-binding to the short cognate DNA does not introduce significant error. However, the same applies to nonspecific DNA only if longer fragments (>0.2 kbp) are used.',\n",

Some species of Phyllanthus were found to exhibit hepatoprotective activity against drugs or toxins and this property was majorly attributed to phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin. In this study, we examined the hepatoprotective activity of five different species of Phyllanthus, namely, Phyllanthus amarus, Phyllanthus fraternus, Phyllanthus maderaspatensis, Phyllanthus urinaria, and Phyllanthus Rotundifolius. The extracts were also evaluated for the presence of key phytoconstituents, phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin. Materials and Methods: The extracts were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against tert-butyl hydroxide (t-BH)-induced cytotoxicity using human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2 cell line). Results: Only P. urinaria and P. maderaspatensis exhibited significant hepatoprotective activity as evident from increased cell viability. The HPLC profile revealed that except P. amarus, the other extracts did not contain phyllanthin and hypophyllanthin. Conclusion: P. urinaria and P. maderaspatensis demonstrated dose-dependent hepatoprotective activity and hence, can provide promising therapeutic interventions against chemical-induced liver damage.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Quantum cavities or dots have markedly different properties depending on whether their classical counterparts are chaotic or not. Connecting a superconductor to such a cavity leads to notable proximity effects, particularly the appearance, predicted by random matrix theory, of a hard gap in the excitation spectrum of quantum chaotic systems. Andreev billiards are interesting examples of such structures built with superconductors connected to a ballistic normal metal billiard since each time an electron hits the superconducting part it is retroreflected as a hole (and vice- versa). Using a semiclassical framework for systems with chaotic dynamics, we show how this reflection, along with the interference due to subtle correlations between the classical paths of electrons and holes inside the system, are ultimately responsible for the gap formation. The treatment can be extended to include the effects of a symmetry breaking magnetic field in the normal part of the billiard or an Andreev billiard connected to two phase shifted superconductors. Therefore we are able to see how these effects can remold and eventually suppress the gap. Furthermore the semiclassical framework is able to cover the effect of a finite Ehrenfest time which also causes the gap to shrink. However for intermediate values this leads to the appearance of a second hard gap - a clear signature of the Ehrenfest time.',\n",

In the present study we tested the in vitro antitumor activities of BI 2536, a selective inhibitor of PLK1, against two melanoma cell lines. Our results showed that nanomolar concentrations (10-150 nmol/L) of the drug significantly decreased cell proliferation and clonogenicity, promoting cell cycle arrest in G2/M. Targeting the cell cycle offers an attractive potential cancer-treatment option. Herein we show that PLK1 inhibition may be a feasible approach for the impairment of tumor progression and dissemination.

The adsorption of As(V) on soil minerals such as ferrihydrite and δ-MnO₂ controls the transport and bioavailability of As(V) in the soil environment. A large number of studies have investigated the equilibrium and mechanisms of As(V) adsorption onto ferrihydrite and δ-MnO₂ individually. However, both ferrihydrite and δ-MnO₂, commonly coexisting within soils has been overlooked and little information is available for the kinetics of As(V) adsorption and desorption in this mixed mineral system. Therefore, in this work, kinetics of As(V) adsorption and desorption onto ferrihydrite and δ-MnO₂ mixed minerals is studied using the stirred-flow method. A kinetics model for the mixed mineral system was developed using the component additivity approach, which incorporated the nonlinear binding of As(V) to both ferrihydrite and δ-MnO₂ simultaneously. The kinetics model successfully predicted the kinetics of As(V) adsorption and desorption in the mixed mineral system under varying solution chemistry conditions and properly accounted for the heterogeneity of the binding sites of both ferrihydrite and δ-MnO₂. For As(V) adsorption kinetics, the ferrihydrite bidentate non-protonated sites (Fh-bi-np) played a dominant role, followed by the δ-MnO₂ binding sites and the ferrihydrite bidentate protonated sites (Fh-bi-p). After the 4-h desorption, As(V) was mainly retained on ferrihydrite binding sites. This study helps to quantitatively elucidate the kinetic behavior and mechanisms of As(V) in the Fe oxide and Mn oxide systems, thus enhancing our understanding of the fate and transport of As in soil environments.',\n",

Evidence has been reported supporting regeneration via transplantation of multiple cell types, as well as replication of postmitotic cardiomyocytes. In addition, the adult myocardium harbors endogenous c-kit pos   cardiac stem cells (eCSCs), whose relevance for regeneration is controversial. Here, using different rodent models of diffuse myocardial damage causing acute heart failure, we show that eCSCs restore cardiac function by regenerating lost cardiomyocytes. Ablation of the eCSC abolishes regeneration and functional recovery. The regenerative process is completely restored by replacing the ablated eCSCs with the progeny of one eCSC. eCSCs recovered from the host and recloned retain their regenerative potential in\\xa0vivo and in\\xa0vitro. After regeneration, selective suicide of these exogenous CSCs and their progeny abolishes regeneration, severely impairing ventricular performance. These data show that c-kit pos   eCSCs are necessary and sufficient for the regeneration and repair of myocardial damage.',\n",

The result confirmed efficacy of elcatonin and safety in combination therapies of elcatonin (C-E). Postmenopausal osteoporosis is an important issue in global aging trends. One treatment of osteoporosis is elcatonin, a kind of calcitonin. However, it has been challenged for long time because of safety. Many trials investigated on this topic, but they were designed differently. Those designs can be categorized in monotherapy of elcatonin (M-E) and C-E. Unfortunately, no synthesized evidence dealt this topic. This study systematically identified target trials from six important databases and only included randomized controlled trial for synthesis. Two investigators assessed quality of eligible trials using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and they independently extracted data. Network meta-analysis performed Peto odds ratio (POR, used for dealing with zero cell) or weighted mean difference (WMD, for continuous data) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and consistency H. Sixteen trials recruiting 2754 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis were included in our study. Elcatonin therapies and non-elcatonin medications had comparable fracture rates and bone mineral density change. Yet, C-E (WMD, −\\u200918.93; 95% CI, −\\u200923.97 to −\\u200913.89) and M-E (WMD, −\\u200913.72; 95% CI, −\\u200919.51 to −\\u20097.94) had significantly lower pain score than non-elcatonin medications. However, M-E (POR\\u2009=\\u20098.413, 95% CI, 2.031 to 34.859) and non-elcatonin medication (Peto OR, 7.450; 95% CI, 1.479 to 37.530) had significantly higher complication rates than placebo. No evidence detected inconsistency and small study effect in this network model. Based on current evidence, C-E may be considered for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis because it benefits on pain relief and complications. Moreover, it shows comparable fracture rate and bone mineral density change as compared with anti-osteoporosis and calcium supplements. Nevertheless, further trials are needed to investigate formula and dosages of elcatonin.',\n",

Most current studies have focused on the decomposition process of plant litter in streams, and the effects of non-woody and woody litter on metal transfer, accumulation, and storage in streams are poorly understood. Here, we addressed how non-woody and woody litter affect metals in headwater streams in an alpine forest on the Eastern Tibetan Plateau. This area is the source of many rivers and plays an important regulatory role in the regional climate and water conservation. Through comparisons of five metal concentrations, exports and storage in headwater streams with different input conditions of plant litter, our results showed that the input of woody litter could significantly increase flow discharge and increase the metal export ratio in the water. Similarly, the input of non-woody litter could reduce the metal concentration in the water and facilitate the stable storage of metals in the sediment in the headwater streams. Therefore, allochthonous non-woody and woody litter can affect the concentration of metals in water and sediment, and the transfer and accumulation of metals from upstream to downstream in headwater streams. This study provides basic data and new findings for understanding the effects of allochthonous plant litter on the accumulation and storage of metals in headwater forest streams and may provide new ideas for assessing and managing water quality in headwater streams in alpine forests.',\n",

In fact, the allocated results are not reasonable for mechanical products; even the allocation granularity is not appropriate to guide the reliability design. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an allocation method based on meta-action. By using the function-movement-action method, we decompose the mechanical product into meta-actions. An action is used as the basic unit of reliability control, and all the parts contributing to the action are treated as a whole. The interactions of the parts which contribute to the same action are treated as the internal forces of meta-actions, and others are considered as the interactions between meta-actions by the consideration of common parts in different units. An illustrative example shows the proposed method makes the results more reasonable and more convenient to guide mechanical product designs.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Seed-mediated methods are widely used in industrial or academic laboratories for the synthesis of nanoparticles of controlled shape and size. In the natural medium, precipitation of secondary minerals also often take place on seeds. In this context, we have devised a formalism which accounts for the competition between seed growth and nucleation and growth of secondary particles in an initially over-saturated aqueous solution. Based on the classical nucleation theory, it involves a size-dependent growth law which accounts for Ostwald ripening effects, unlike most water–rock interaction codes. We find that, in such closed system, seed growth and nucleation/growth of secondary particles are strongly coupled. In the multi-dimensional parameter space, regions where one or the other process prevails are well-separated by a rather abrupt transition. In general, the value of the initial seed total surface area is insufficient to fully orientate the synthesis. Relying on this approach, we propose an alternative interpretation of recent experimental results on amorphous silica nanoparticle synthesis. Besides fundamental understanding of the kinetics of precipitation, the interest of the present approach is to serve as a guideline to experimentalists or industrialists working in seed-mediated syntheses and warn on the undesired formation of secondary particles when monodispersed distributions of nano- or micro-particles are searched.',\n",

The research was performed in a Psychosocial Alcohol and Drug Attention Center of a municipality in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with 13 professionals and 12 family members of users of psychoactive substances, from July to November, 2016. The steps suggested by Social Phenomenology researchers were used for data analysis. Results: three categories were revealed: care actions for family members from the perspective of professionals; care actions identified by family members, and reciprocity of perspectives in relation to care actions for family members. The professionals reported care actions developed in the service for the family: listening, reception, individual care, guidance, referrals, family groups and home visits; and care actions identified by family members: family group, care, reception, resolution, psychological support and guidance. The reciprocity of perspectives in relation to care actions for family members, from the perspective of the professionals and family members was: a group of family members, reception and guidance. Conclusion: the findings provide support to professionals to review their health care actions, based on the expectations of care mentioned by family members as well the contribution to comprehensive and resolute mental health care, especially in out-of-hospital care.',\n",

This study focuses on investigating palm oil mill effluent (POME) as the alternate carbon source for supporting ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in ammonia removal of glove industrial wastewater treatment. Ammonia reduction efficiency was compared between POME with molasses, one of the most commonly used carbon sources. POME as carbon source in ammonia wastewater treatment had shown significant comparable reduction efficiency as compared to molasses. Furthermore, the study on various mixture ratios of POME-molasses had also shown further improvement in ammonia reduction efficiency. At the optimum ratio of 50:50 (v/v) POME-molasses as carbon source mixture, the ammonia reduction in the treatment system had achieved 53.11% reduction, which reduced ammonia content down to 10.49 mg/L NH3. In this study, the results suggested that POME showing great potential to be the new cost-effective carbon source alternative in industry scale treatment.',\n",

METHODS Secondary data analysis was used on the Fall 2017 entering cohort of doctor of chiropractic students. Independent samples t-tests and ordinary least squares linear regression were used to explain the extent to which incoming undergraduate GPA, undergraduate chemistry grade, undergraduate anatomy and physiology grade, and age, respectfully, influenced the end-of-trimester GPA. RESULTS Linear regression found each of the four independent variables (undergraduate GPA, undergraduate chemistry grade, undergraduate anatomy and physiology grade, and age) to be significant influencers of end-of-trimester-1 GPA with undergraduate GPA being the most statistically significant predictor (p < .001).The difference in mean end-of-trimester GPAs for male and female students was not statistically significant. There also was no difference in mean end-of-trimester GPAs by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION Current admissions requirements may need to emphasize incoming undergraduate GPA and target student support for older students. This study should be repeated for increased sample size, be performed at other chiropractic institutions, and consider additional cohorts to strengthen results.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The interpretation of various cardiovascular blood flow abnormalities can be identified using Electrocardiogram (ECG). The predominant anomaly due to the blood flow dynamics leads to the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in the cardiac system. In this work, estimation of cardiac output (CO) parameter using blood flow rate analysis is carried out, which is a vital parameter to identify the subjects with left- ventricular arrhythmias (LVA). In particular, LVA is a resultant component of characteristic changes in blood rheology (blood flow rate). The CO is an intrinsic parameter derived from the stroke volume (SV) characterized by end-diastolic/systolic volumes (EDV/ESV) and heart rate. The pumping of blood from left ventricle (LV) reconciles in to R-R intervals depicted on ECG, which are used for heart rate estimation. The deviation from the nominal values of CO implies that, the subject is more prone to LVA. Further, the identification of subjects with LVA is accomplished by computing the features from the ECG signals. The proposed Feature Ranking Score (FRS) algorithm employs different statistical parameters to label the score of the extracted features. The feature score enables the selection optimal features for classification. The optimal features are further given to the Least Square- Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier for training and testing phases. The signals are acquired from public domain MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, used for validating the proposed technique for identifying the LVA using blood flow.',\n",

Here, we investigate these complex processes using micropatterned cell adhesive frames. Spreading kinetics on these matrices depend strongly on initial adhesive position and are predicted by a cellular Potts model (CPM), which reflects a balance between adhesion and intracellular tension. As cells spread, new stress fibers (SFs) assemble periodically and parallel to the leading edge, with spatial intervals of ∼2.5\\xa0μm, temporal intervals of ∼15\\xa0min, and characteristic lifetimes of ∼50\\xa0min. By incorporating these rules into the CPM, we can successfully predict SF network architecture. Moreover, we observe broadly similar behavior when we culture cells on arrays of discrete collagen fibers. Our findings show that ECM geometry and initial cell position strongly determine cell spreading and that cells encode a memory of their spreading history through SF network organization.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Polyzwitterionic brushes with strong anti-polyelectrolyte effect have shown great potential as smart surfaces for tunable lubrication, protein absorption/desorption, and bacteria killing and release. However, due to the brush structure in which polymer chain is tethered on the substrate by one end, this surface is easily destroyed from the detachment of the brush, greatly limiting its real-world applications. To solve this problem, herein, cross-linked structure was introduced in poly(3-(dimethyl (4-vinylbenzyl) ammonium) propyl sulfonate) (polyDVBAPS) brushes to offer the long-term stability. The cross-link structure was fabricated by adding a cross-linker during the surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, and the effect of such structure on the surface morphology, salt-responsive behavior, and long-term stability were investigated. The results indicated that the cross-link structure with tunable cross-link density could be readily prepared by this method. The responsive behaviors, such as switch between friction and lubrication, bacteria release in response to salt solution, were well-retained by the cross-linked polyDVBAPS brush. More importantly, high long-term stability was endowed by the cross-link structure, from which the cross-linked brush not only showed long-time lubrication and high load resistance during friction measurements, but also exhibited a high retention ratio (more than 90%) of bacteria release capability even after 30 water/salt solution switch cycles, in contrast, the non-cross-linked brush showed a low retention ratio of ˜50% after the similar treatment. These results indicated that cross-linked structure could be an efficient method to enhance the stability of responsive polymer brushes and greatly strengthen the practicability of such brushes in real-world applications.',\n",

Development of predictive biomarkers, new therapeutic concepts, and epidemiologic research require a valid, reproducible, and quantitative measure describing CAP severity. Using time series data of 1532 patients enrolled in the PROGRESS study, we compared putative measures of CAP severity for their utility as an operationalization. Comparison was based on ability to correctly identify patients with an objectively severe state of disease (death or need for intensive care with at least one of the following: substantial respiratory support, treatment with catecholamines, or dialysis). We considered IDSA/ATS minor criteria, CRB-65, CURB-65, Halm criteria, qSOFA, PSI, SCAP, SIRS-Score, SMART-COP, and SOFA. SOFA significantly outperformed other scores in correctly identifying a severe state of disease at the day of enrollment (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.948), mainly caused by higher discriminative power at higher score values. Runners-up were the sum of IDSA/ATS minor criteria (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.916) and SCAP (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.868). SOFA performed similarly well on subsequent study days (all AUC\\u2009>\\u20090.9) and across age groups. In univariate and multivariate analysis, age, sex, and pack-years significantly contributed to higher SOFA values whereas antibiosis before hospitalization predicted lower SOFA.

This study was undertaken in order to document the efficacy and side-effects of epidural morphine instead of patient-controlled analgesia technique used for the control of post-cesarean pain during postoperative 24-48 hours. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was performed as a retrospective review of patient charts who had received combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia. Post-cesarean analgesia was performed with epidural technique either by using (Group 1) patient-controlled epidural analgesia for 48 hours, or (Group 2) patient-controlled epidural analgesia for the first 24 hours and then single dose of 3 mg epidural morphine for the second 24 hours. RESULTS Incidences of side-effects were similar in both groups. None of the patients experienced respiratory depression. Additional analgesia was used on an as-required basis in nine of 39 (23%) patients in Group 1 and six of 39 (13%) in Group 2. CONCLUSION Small doses of epidural morphine provides up to 24 hours of pain relief from a single injection and could obviate the need for an indwelling epidural catheter on the second day of postcesarean section, thus reducing the potential for catheter-related complications.',\n",

A programme of work was subsequently developed from 2010–2014 including an innovative e-learning programme and important projects seeking to explore issues around competence of care skills and communication challenges in the field of children and young people with palliative care.   Aims   The aim in this workshop is to share reflections from a recent narrative literature review as part of a programme of work which focused on confidence and competence of care skills. Results of the review will be shared but will provide a platform for critical debate around challenges and new directions in children and young people’s palliative care.   Methods   A narrative review will be firstly shared. Combinations of selected key words were systematically applied to identify research on health professionals’ confidence and competence when caring for children and young people’s using palliative care services. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were read and descriptively summarised using data extraction sheets. A narrative synthesis was conducted by examining commonly reported issues which were then condensed into overarching themes.   Results   Limited research is available that explores health professionals’ confidence and competence when caring for children and young people’s using palliative care services. Technological advancements, range of conditions/needs; communication challenges/decision-making and resource costs including specialist staff featured as significant themes. Improvements in staff education and training may help to overcome some of the identified issues.

Although evidence on the various interrelationships between work stress and CVD has been accumulated, those observations have not yet been conceptualized in terms of a life course perspective. Using the chain of risk model, we would like to propose a theoretical model incorporating six steps: (1) work stress increases the risk of incident CVD in healthy workers. (2) Among those whose work ability is not fully and permanently damaged, work stress acts as a determinant of the process of return to work after CVD onset. (3) CVD patients experience higher work stress after return to work. (4) Work stress increases the risk of recurrent CVD in workers with prior CVD. (5) CVD patients who fully lose their work ability transit to disability retirement. (6) Disability retirees due to CVD have an elevated risk of CVD mortality. The life course perspective might facilitate an in-depth understanding of the diverse interrelationships between work stress and CVD, thereby leading to work stress management interventions at each period of the lifespan and three-level prevention of CVD.',\n",

Drawing on qualitative evaluation data generated within an on-going process evaluation of a regional health-promoting schools network in Austria, we demonstrate which desirable and undesirable effects HP practice can have for teachers. Thirteen group discussions with teachers (n = 63) and headteachers (n = 9) acting as health coordinators in the network schools were conducted between 2010 and 2013. These data were analysed using systems and thematic analyses. In our example, desirable side effects included health coordinators gaining new relationships, new skills and benefiting from improved infrastructure. The undesirable side effects centred on stress, work overload and frustration, due to the additional work brought about by HP practice, negative reactions by colleagues as well as by technicalities of the network. The undesirable side effects of HP predominated in our study, pointing to several implications like the need to accommodate the concept of HP in the teachers' core responsibilities; the participation of all staff members and students in a whole-school approach toward SHP, and the need for changes on an organizational level. Based on this study, we come to the conclusion that a systematic approach to investigating and analysing side effects of HP is currently lacking in HP research and suggest that theoretical examination and more empirical research is needed.\",\n",

Inhibitor from recycled cigarette butts shows good inhibition properties, but we do not know whether CuCl can help to improve the inhibition efficiency. So, in this study, the impact of CuCl on recycled cigarette butts as corrosion inhibitor for N80 steel at 90 °C in 15% HCl is studied by weight loss, electrochemical noise, polarization, impedance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. All the results show that the inhibition efficiency of water extracts from cigarette butts in the presence of CuCl is higher than in absence of CuCl, and it can reach 95.3% when 9% water extracts with copper added is used. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that the N80 steel specimen surface is undamaged and covered with a protective coat formed by copper-added water extracts from cigarette butts.

       "  'abstract': 'Study objectives   To examine the longitudinal relationship between sleep problems and development of antisocial behavior from adolescence through young adulthood, and to investigate whether family functioning moderates the association being examined. Potential sex differences were also explored.   Methods   A total of 2,491 adolescents participated in a prospective study spanning 2009 through 2014 in northern Taiwan. Measures included sleep problems, family functioning (parental support, family interaction, and family conflict), antisocial behavior, and other individual characteristics (sex, age, parental education, family economic stress, depressive symptoms, and stressful life events). Random coefficient growth models were used to test study hypotheses.   Results   Sleep problems were significantly and positively associated with antisocial behavior (B = 0.088 and 0.038 for males and females, respectively). Sex differences further emerged in the moderating effects of family functioning. Among males, those with high family interaction had a weaker association between sleep problems and antisocial behavior; among females, the examined association was weaker in those with high parental support. For both sexes, the association between sleep problems and antisocial behavior was stronger for those with high family conflict.   Conclusions   Our findings highlight the robust link between sleep problems and adolescent antisocial behavior over time. We also show for the first time that the association depends on family functioning. Prevention methods and treatment of sleep problems in youths that incorporate family functioning may yield significant benefits for decreasing antisocial behavior. Sex-specific intervention and prevention approaches should also be considered.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In breast cancer, prolactin-induced activation of the transcription factor STAT5a results from the phosphorylation of STAT5a tyrosine residue 694. However, its role in mammary oncogenesis remains an unsettled debate as STAT5a exhibits functional dichotomy with both pro-differentiative and pro-proliferative target genes. Phosphorylation of STAT5a serine residues, S726 and S780, may regulate STAT5a in such a way to underlie this duality. Given hematopoiesis studies showing phospho-serine STAT5a as necessary for transformation, we hypothesized that serine phosphorylation regulates STAT5a activity to contribute to its role in mammary oncogenesis, specifically in luminal breast cancer. Here, phosphorylation of S726-, S780-, and Y694-STAT5a in response to prolactin in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells was investigated with STAT5a knockdown and rescue with Y694F-, S726A-, or S780A-STAT5a, where the phospho-sites were mutated. RNA-sequencing and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that loss of each phospho-site differentially affected both prolactin-induced gene expression as well as functional pathways of breast cancer (e.g. cell survival, proliferation, and colony formation). In vitro studies of anchorage-independent growth and proliferation confirmed distinct phenotypes: whereas S780A-STAT5a decreased clonogenicity, S726A-STAT5a decreased proliferation in response to prolactin compared to wild type STAT5a. Collectively, these studies provide novel insights into STAT5a activation in breast cancer pathogenesis.',\n",

This limitation is attributable to the passage dependent declines in their proliferative activity. We describe here development of a novel 6C medium that contains six different modulators of different signaling pathways, which control proliferative mCEC activity. Its usage shortens the time and effort required to obtain epithelial sheets for hastening healing of an epithelial wound in an experimental animal model. This serum-free 6C medium contains:Y27632, forskolin, SB431542, DAPT, IWP-2, LDN-193189 and also DermaLife K keratinocyte calcium. Their inclusion inhibits rises in four specific markers of epithelial mesenchymal transdifferentiation:ZEB1/2, Snail, β-catenin and α-SMA. This medium is applied in a feeder-free air-lifted system to obtain sufficient populations of epithelial progenitor cells whose procurement is facilitated due to suppression of progenitor epithelial cell transdifferentiation into epithelial-mesenchymal cells. Diminution of this decline in transdifferentiation was confirmed based on the invariance of P63, K14, Pax6, and K12 gene expression levels. This cell culture technique is expected to facilitate ex vivo characterization of mechanisms underlying cell fate determination. Furthermore, its implementation will improve yields of progenitor mouse corneal epithelial cells, which increases the likelihood of using these cells as a source to generate epithelial sheets for performing transplantation surgery to treat limbal stem cell deficiency in a clinical setting. In addition, the novel insight obtainable from such studies is expected to improve the outcomes of corneal regenerative medicine.',\n",

One key to improving methods of species management is to better monitor and understand elephant nutrition. Analyzing circulating nutrients is one of the best and least invasive methods of monitoring managed elephant nutrition, but limited reference values are available. This study examined the circulating basic hematology concentrations, minerals, vitamins A, D, and E, and fatty acids of six African elephants (two males and four females) at the North Carolina Zoo collected monthly from March 2016 to April 2017 and compared levels among seasons. Creatinine (CRE) and albumin had seasonal differences (p ≤ .05). Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, zinc, cobalt, manganese, and molybdenum displayed seasonal differences (p ≤ .05). Retinol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 had seasonal differences (p ≤ .05). Linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, total omega-3 fatty acids, total omega-6 fatty acids, and the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio showed seasonal differences (p ≤ .05). Findings suggest that exogenous vitamin E supplements may not be necessary with a mixed feedstuff diet (hay, fortified concentrate pellet, browse, and produce) based on circulating values.

No significant differences were observed between the two salinities for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total chemical oxygen demand (CODt), and fixed suspended solids (FSS). Using CODt/BOD5, it was possible to identify the water biodegradability and manage the concentration of organic and inorganic matter in the medium. Filtered chemical oxygen demand (CODf) was used to monitor the dissolved organic matter, which was higher in T16.

Dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxygen saturation (sO2) were significantly different between the treatments. The maintenance of a more neutral pH and greater alkalinity were observed, with significant differences between the treatments throughout the whole cultivation.

Metabolic activity, DNA content, the content of soluble mediators in the media, and the gene expression of tendon-specific, inflammatory, and catabolic markers were analyzed. μFAT-treated TCs showed a reduced expression of PTGS2 and MMP-3 with respect to untreated controls. Increased IL-1Ra, VEGF, and IL-6 content were observed in the media of μFAT-treated samples, in comparison with untreated TCs. μFAT exerted an anti-inflammatory action on supraspinatus tendon cells in vitro through paracrine action, resulting in the reduction of catabolic and inflammatory marker expression. These observations potentially support the use of μFAT as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of rotator cuff disease.',\n",

In this study, we investigate how approaching sounds stopping at different distances within the peripersonal space, and carrying emotional content (positive, negative, and neutral), modulate the preparation of action as performing a Step. Premotor reaction times were measured by means of anticipatory forces and muscular activations to capture action preparation, the kinematics of stepping was considered for defining action performance, and for each stimulus, the individual perceived level of arousal and valence was evaluated. In general, we found a prompter premotor reaction for closer sounds compared to the farther ones and the fastest reactions detected for the neutral sound at each distance. We interpreted this time facilitation for neutral sound due to the large frequency spectrum of the stimuli and the absence of affective component and semantical content to decode. Interestingly, while at the close distance, none difference was found between positive and negative emotional stimuli, at the far distance faster reactions were present for negative compared to the positive sounds indicating that when arousal is less enhanced individuals are able to differentiate the emotional content of a sound. The kinematics observed after action initiation sustained the anticipatory results by showing that larger steps were performed when reacting to close compared to far sounds, being perceived as more arousing, and this happened particularly for neutral and negative sounds. Altogether, the results showed that action preparation is influenced by the vicinity and by the valence carried by looming auditory stimuli. For discriminating the stimuli valence, a certain distance, still within the PPS, is necessary; when instead stimuli are too close to the body valence discrimination is not performed.',\n",

Professional MMA competitors in California are required to weigh in twice: 24\\xa0hr prior to competition and immediately prior to the bout after they have typically engaged in RWG. In analyzing data from five MMA events sanctioned by the Californian State Athletic Commission, the authors used Bayesian analyses to compare bout winners (n = 31) and losers (n = 31) in terms of in-competition BM (in kilograms) and the amount of BM regained between the two weigh-ins (in kilograms). These data do not support the hypothesis that differences in in-competition BM (Bayes factor [BF10] = 0.667, d = 0.23) or the amount of BM regained between the two weigh-ins (BF10 = 0.821, d = 0.23) determine winning or losing.

In conclusion, the authors report for the first time that the magnitude of RWG does not predict winning or losing in a professional cohort of MMA athletes. In addition, they also report that MMA athletes typically compete at a BM that is at least 1-2 divisions higher than the division in which they officially weighed-in.

Native aortic valve regurgitation, defined as primary aortic incompetence not associated with aortic stenosis or failed valve replacement, on the other hand, is still considered a relative contraindication for transcatheter aortic valve therapies, because of the absence of annular or leaflet calcification required for secure anchoring of the transcatheter heart valve. In addition, severe aortic regurgitation often coexists with aortic root or ascending aorta dilatation, the treatment of which mandates operative intervention. For these reasons, transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been only sporadically used to treat pure aortic incompetence, typically on a compassionate basis and in surgically inoperable patients. More recently, however, transcatheter aortic valve replacement for native aortic valve regurgitation has been trialled with newer-generation heart valves, with encouraging results, and new ancillary devices have emerged that are designed to stabilize the annulus-root complex.

These include the accelerated rate of climate change, pandemic threats, systemic racism, growing health and social inequities, and the regulation of new technologies to ensure an equitable future 'for all.' In nursing codes of ethics, administration, education, policies, and practice, social justice is often claimed to be a core value, yet it is rarely contextualized by philosophical or theoretical underpinnings. It appears that nurses' commitment to social justice may stem more from a penchant for 'doing good' than an attempt to explore, understand, and enact what is meant by social justice from an ontological, epistemological, and methodological perspective. We contend that the dominance of a human science perspective in nursing contributes to a narrow definition of health and relegates many issues central to social justice to the margins of nurses' care. In this article, we explore how the focus on 'the human' in the human science perspective may not only be limiting the capacity of nurses to develop strategies to adequately address social injustice, but in some instances, direct nurses to contribute to their very reproduction. We suggest that a critical interrogation of this human-centric hegemony can identify avenues of rupture and introduce posthumanism as an additional philosophical perspective for consideration to help bridge the human-social divide.\",\n",

We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders. We did not observe an association between rotating night work duration and colorectal cancer risk in these cohorts (NHS: 1-14 years: Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.16; 15+ years: HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.39; Ptrend = 0.14 and NHS2: 1-14 years: HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.99; 15+ years: HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.64 and Ptrend = 0.88). In subsite analysis in NHS, rectal cancer risk increased after long-term (15+ years) rotating night shift work (proximal colon cancer: HR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.75, 1.34, Ptrend = 0.90; distal colon cancer: HR 1.27, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.85, Ptrend = 0.32; rectal cancer: HR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.34, Ptrend = 0.02). We found no overall evidence of an association between rotating night shift work and colorectal cancer risk in these two large cohorts of nurses. Risk for rectal cancer significantly increased with shift work duration, suggesting that long-term circadian disruption may play a role in rectal cancer development.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A fundamental challenge in the development of cancer therapies is the co-development of companion biomarkers to select patients most likely to respond to treatment prior to the availability of clinical outcomes data. We developed a methodology that leverages large scale public ‘omics data to identify candidate predictive biomarker panels to identify patients with a greater likelihood of responding to targeted therapies. We applied this approach to generate mechanism-based predictive biomarkers using our causal Knowledgebase as a substrate, as well as standard gene expression-based biomarkers for c-Met targeted therapy use in lung and colon cancers, and validated the methodology using clinical data. Gene signatures for c-Met activation in lung and colon were applied to individual lung and colon cancer training set patients to stratify them by c-Met activation levels. Data from patients identified as having high and low levels of c-Met activation were used to develop mechanism-based and gene expression-based classifiers to predict response to c-Met targeted therapies in lung and colon cancer. Validation of these classifiers requires transcriptomic data with associated clinical outcomes from c-Met inhibitor trials. In the absence of such, we verified this general approach using data from Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients treated with the TNF inhibitor Infliximab, for which published colon transcriptomic data and associated clinical outcomes data are available {GSE16879} We developed a gene signature to assess TNF pathway activation and stratify a training set of IBD patients, then generated gene expression and mechanism-based classifiers from patients with high and low TNF signaling. These classifiers were tested on an independent test set of IBD patients treated with Infliximab {GSE12251}; the mechanism and gene expression-based classifiers predicted responders with positive and negative predictive values of 85%/88% and 70%/100% respectively. This method can be applied to other targets, pathways and diseases and may facilitate companion diagnostic development by enabling the selection of appropriate patient populations prior to treatment and clinical trial participation.

The serious cardiac adverse events (SCAEs) after decompressive craniectomy for malignant cerebral infarction from ischemic stroke were studied retrospectively. METHODS Retrospective data were collected for preexisting cardiac risk factors, baseline clinical measures, and perioperative SCAEs including life-threatening arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest. The association between perioperative SCAEs and mortality was assessed using the χ(2) test. RESULTS Data from 42 patients were analyzed. Mortality occurred in 19 (45.2%) patients. Eleven (57.9% of deaths) suffered mortality because of neurological causes, 7 patients (36.8% of mortality) because of cardiac causes, and 1 because of other causes. Mortality in patients who developed SCAEs was significantly higher than in those without SCAEs [75% mortality with SCAEs vs. 18.2% without SCAEs (P<0.0001)].

       "  'abstract': 'During pregnancy the myometrium undergoes a programme of differentiation induced by endocrine, cellular, and biophysical inputs. Small heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of ten (B1-B10) small-molecular-weight proteins that not only act as chaperones, but also assist in processes such as cytoskeleton rearrangements and immune system activation. Thus, it was hypothesized that HSPB5 (CRYAB) would be highly expressed in the rat myometrium during the contractile and labour phases of myometrial differentiation when such processes are prominent. Immunoblot analysis revealed that myometrial CRYAB protein expression significantly increased from day (D) 15 to D23 (labour; P<0.05). In correlation with these findings, serine 59-phosphorylated (pSer59) CRYAB protein expression significantly increased from D15 to D23, and was also elevated 1-day post-partum (P<0.05). pSer59-CRYAB was detected in the cytoplasm of myocytes within both uterine muscle layers mid- to late-pregnancy. In unilaterally pregnant rats, pSer59-CRYAB protein expression was significantly elevated in the gravid uterine horns at both D19 and D23 of gestation compared with non-gravid horns. Co-immunolocalization experiments using the hTERT-human myometrial cell line and confocal microscopy demonstrated that pSer59-CRYAB co-localized with the focal adhesion protein FERMT2 at the ends of actin filaments as well as with the exosomal marker CD63. Overall, pSer59-CRYAB is highly expressed in myometrium during late pregnancy and labour and its expression appears to be regulated by uterine distension. CRYAB may be involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics at focal adhesions and could be secreted by exosomes as a prelude to involvement in immune activation in the myometrium.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Background   Chronic depression is the most frequent psychiatric disorder in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. It9s considered that both depressive disorders and RA are stress-related and have a common proinflammatory pathogenesis. Moreover, depression decreases adherence to treatment and worsen the RA prognosis. That is why untreated depression may deteriorate the joints destruction in RA patients.   Objectives   To determine the factors associated with joints destruction in RA patients by linear regression analysis and the influence of chronic depression on joints destruction.   Methods   125 RA patients were enrolled in this study. 86% were women with a mean age of 47.4±11.3 (M±m). The disease activity was assessed by DAS28 score. 52% of RA patients had a high activity of disease (DAS28>5,1). 67% of patients were taking prednisone in mean dose 5±2.7 mg/day (M±m). 80% were taking DMARDs: most of them - methotrexate (45%) and leflunomide (21%). All patients were taking NSADs. Psychiatric disorders was diagnosed by psychiatrist in accordance with the ICD-10 criteria in semi-structured interview. Psychiatric scales were used: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Anxiety-depressive disorders were diagnosed in 93,6% of RA patients. Chronic depression - dysthymia and recurrent depressive disorder prevailed (32,8% and 25,6% accordingly). All patients were consulted by cardiologist. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used for osteoporosis detection.   Results   Most of RA patients (65,6%) had severe joints destruction - numerous bones erosions (III-IV X-ray stage of RA) or aseptic bones necrosis. The factors associated with severe joints destruction were found in Pearson correlation analysis. Then linear regression analysis was done and obtaining prognostic model showed that joints destruction was associated with RA (β=0,520) duration, chronic depression (dysthymia and recurrent depressive disorder) (β=0,235) and it9s duration (β=-0,124), osteoporosis (β=0,196) and ischemic heart disease (β=0,181), low body mass index (β=-0,108) and high RF-IgM level (β=0,121) (area under the ROC curve =0,930).   Conclusions   Chronic depression and it9s duration along with RA duration, osteoporosis and ischemic heart disease, low body mass index and high rheumatoid factor level are the leading factors of joints destruction in RA patients.

       "  'abstract': 'Internal radiation dose assessment involves biokinetic models, the corresponding parameters, measured data, and many assumptions. Every component considered in the internal dose assessment has its own uncertainty, which is propagated in the intake activity and internal dose estimates. For research or scientific purposes, and for retrospective dose reconstruction for accident scenarios occurring in workplaces having a large quantity of unsealed radionuclides, such as nuclear power plants, nuclear fuel cycle facilities, and facilities in which nuclear medicine is practiced, a quantitative uncertainty assessment of the internal dose is often required. However, no calculation tools or computer codes that incorporate all the relevant processes and their corresponding uncertainties, i.e., from the measured data to the committed dose, are available. Thus, the objective of the present study is to develop an integrated probabilistic internal-dose-assessment computer code. First, the uncertainty components in internal dosimetry are identified, and quantitative uncertainty data are collected. Then, an uncertainty database is established for each component. In order to propagate these uncertainties in an internal dose assessment, a probabilistic internal-dose-assessment system that employs the Bayesian and Monte Carlo methods. Based on the developed system, we developed a probabilistic internal-dose-assessment code by using MATLAB so as to estimate the dose distributions from the measured data with uncertainty. Using the developed code, we calculated the internal dose distribution and statistical values (e.g. the 2.5th, 5th, median, 95th, and 97.5th percentiles) for three sample scenarios. On the basis of the distributions, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of each component on the resulting dose in order to identify the major component of the uncertainty in a bioassay. The results of this study can be applied to various situations. In cases of severe internal exposure, the causation probability of a deterministic health effect can be derived from the dose distribution, and a high statistical value (e.g., the 95th percentile of the distribution) can be used to determine the appropriate intervention. The distribution-based sensitivity analysis can also be used to quantify the contribution of each factor to the dose uncertainty, which is essential information for reducing and optimizing the uncertainty in the internal dose assessment. Therefore, the present study can contribute to retrospective dose assessment for accidental internal exposure scenarios, as well as to internal dose monitoring optimization and uncertainty reduction.',\n",

Results show that mass media have a significant direct influence on well-being, with negative effects on physical activity and adherence to a Mediterranean diet. The model fitted better for males in terms of gender differences, showing a better fit of psychological well-being being associated with higher levels of physical activity and better adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Among women, no relationships were found between mass media pressure and psychological well-being and healthy physical habits, but higher personal satisfaction was associated with better physical activity and better dietary patterns.

Gauss partial derivative filter bank can represent texture and edge information in multiple orientations with less computation load than conventional methods and prevent redundancy in different filtered images.

MWM results showed that there were significant deficits of spatial learning and memory in melamine group. The levels of superoxide anion radical, hydroxyl free radical and malonaldehyde (MDA) were significantly increased by melamine, which also reduced the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). The analysis of hippocampal energy metabolism showed that melamine caused significant decrease in the content of adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), implying the reduction of energy synthesis in hippocampal neurocytes. The results suggest that the selective neurotoxicity of melamine in hippocampus may be in part associated with oxidative damage.',\n",

Dengue virus (DV) infections are a major public health concern worldwide, and especially in Asia. In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of action of IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in human lung epithelial cells. The results demonstrated that DV infection induced expression of several IFITs, including IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, and IFIT5 in A549 cells. Induction of IFIT3 by DV infection was also observed in human dendritic cells. In a knockdown study, we showed that a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2), but not STAT1 or STAT3, regulated DV-induced IFIT3 production. By using several different methods to evaluate cell death, we demonstrated that knockdown of IFIT3 led to cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of IFIT3 induced the expression of several apoptotic regulators such as caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). Such apoptotic effects and mechanisms were synergistically enhanced after DV infection. Moreover, under conditions of IFIT3 deficiency, viral production increased, suggesting an anti-viral effect of IFIT3. Interestingly, DV could suppress IFN-α-induced but not IFN-γ-induced IFIT3 expression, a phenomenon similar to the regulation of STATs by DV. In conclusion, this study revealed some mechanisms of IFIT3 induction, and also demonstrated the protective roles of IFIT3 following IFN-α production in DV infection of human lung epithelial cells.',\n",

In this study, we test the hypothesis that glacial–interglacial cycles are traceable from genetic footprints retained within plant species. Fourteen populations belonging to the   Delphinium naviculare   species group were sampled from the Tianshan Mountains in western China, and 14 genotypes were detected based on sequences of the two chloroplast fragments   trn S– trn G and   trn L– trn F. A Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach revealed that genetic divergence in this species group began in the early Pleistocene and intensified during mid-Pleistocene. A lineage-through-time (LTT) plot shows dramatic accumulations of   Delphinium   lineages during the three Pleistocene interglacial periods in this area. From ecological niche modeling (ENM), it appears that the distribution of the species group most likely shrunk in the eastern arid and southwestern high-altitude parts of its range during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), suggesting that cold and drought were primary drivers of lineage migration during glacial periods. Humid valleys at mid-elevation served as refugia at these times; however, during the latest two glacial epochs, new refugia likely appeared, corresponding to a decreased extent of glaciation. In accordance with the glacial chronology derived from many proxy data such as glacial tills, lacustrine sedimentary sequences, and oxygen isotope records, the genetic structure of the   D. naviculare   species group reveals a paleoclimatic history that is able to differentiate three glacial–interglacial cycles and an overall trend towards aridity during the course of the Pleistocene.',\n",

Previously published research proposing a mechanism where the cyclosiloxane EP begins by opening the cyclosiloxane ring at the droplet surface appears improbable because a reaction half-life less than a few seconds would be required.   The aqueous solubility of D4, D5 and D6 was determined as a function of temperature. Most significantly; the rate of reaction of these cyclosiloxanes in EP was then determined to be a linear function of their aqueous solubility at the reaction temperature. Dimethylcyclosiloxane EP was determined to fully conform to the four characteristics of two phase heterogeneous liquid–liquid reaction kinetics wherein the reaction occurs in the aqueous phase.   The kinetic rate equation was developed and the effect of cyclosiloxane mass transfer limitations on reaction rate was shown. (The influence of mass transfer limitations can give an erroneous appearance that reaction occurs at the droplet surface.)

The lateral displacement was also measured as a function of theangle between the electrode and the direction of flow. A simplified line charge model was used for numericalestimation of the lateral displacement of fluorescent polystyrene (PS) beads with three different diameters. Using thelateral displacement as a function of particle size, we developed a lateral dielectrophoretic (DEP) microseparator,which enables the continuous discrimination of particles by size. The experiment using an admixture of 3-, 5-, and10-μm PS beads showed that the lateral DEP microseparator could continuously separate out 99.86% of the 3-μmbeads, 98.82% of the 5-μm beads, and 99.69% of the 10-μm beads. The lateral DEP microseparator is thus apractical device for the simultaneous separation of particles according to size from a heterogeneous admixture.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   Abstract 2575       Introduction:   Few research studies have investigated the nutritional status of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Preliminary studies have found that malnutrition is associated with lower 5-year survival, increased relapse rates and more frequent reductions in chemotherapy dose. The extent of malnutrition has not been well characterized. Results of a prospective multi-institution study investigating dietary micronutrient intake over the course of treatmentfor ALL are reported.       Methods:   Assessment of dietary intake was collected for participants enrolled on the DFCI ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 from 2005–2011. Institutional review board approval was obtained by each of the 9 participating centers. Dietary intake was assessed at three timepoints in therapy: diagnosis (T1), Day 32 (end) of induction therapy (T2), and 15 months post-diagnosis (T3) (during maintenance therapy) with the Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire for children ages 1–5 years and the Youth and Adolescent Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire for children ages 5–18 years. Questionnaires were self-administered and were completed by parents or primary care takers when children were below age 6 years. Dietary intake was examined by comparing energy and nutrient specific consumption above and below recommended intake using age specific values for Dietary Reference Intake (DRI).       Results:   Among 794 patients with ALL registered on the 05-001 Protocol, dietary intake questionnaires were availablefor 622, 564, and 423 patients at T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Median age of participants at T1 was 5 yrs (range 1–17.9 yrs) and 272 (44%) were female, 350 (56%) were male. Initial leukemia risk classification included 363 standard risk (58%) and 259 (42%) high risk. At diagnosis, the majority of children reported consuming more than the age and gender specific DRI. For 388 children (62%), reported caloric intake was >25% the DRI, while another 81 (13%) reported caloric consumption >10% the DRI. In contrast, only 116 (19%) did not meet the DRI. At T2, similar findings were observed, despite administration of a 32 day prednisone course which would have been expected to result in a higher proportion of children exceeding recommended caloric intake. Of those responding at T2, 128 (23%) were not meeting the DRI, while 65 (12%) and 335 (59%) exceeded the recommended caloric intake by >10% and >25% respectively. During maintenance therapy (T3), total caloric intake declined with a greater proportion of participating children reporting intake below the DRI (30%) and a smaller proportion reporting intake >25%DRI (49%), while the proportion consuming recommended intake or >10% DRI remained stable. Distribution of children reporting nutrient consumption below, at, or above age and gender specific DRI values for key micronutrients is summarized in   Figure 1 . The majority of patients did not meet the DRI for vitamin E and vitamin D at all 3 time points, while nearly half the participants exceeded the DRI for zinc and folate.       Conclusions:   The majority of children with newly diagnosed ALL have evidence of overnutrition or malnutrition, as demonstrated by overconsumption of calories, or deficiency or overconsumption of key micronutrients, which may be associated with increased risk for treatment related toxicities. Increased consumption of folate during the maintenance phase in which methotrexate is a major component of treatment also needs further study. Additional analyses are underway to explore these relationships.\\n               Download :   Download high-res image (36KB)             Download :   Download full-size image                   Figure 1 .

A previous study revealed that the right PMd is characterized by a rostro-caudal and a ventro-dorsal distinction dividing it into five subregions: rostral, central, caudal, ventral and dorsal. The present study assessed whether a similar organization is present in the left hemisphere, by capitalizing on a multimodal data-driven approach combining connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) based on meta-analytic modeling, resting-state functional connectivity, and probabilistic diffusion tractography. The resulting PMd modules were then characterized based on multimodal functional connectivity and a quantitative analysis of associated behavioral functions. Analyzing the clusters consistent across all modalities revealed an organization of the left PMd that mirrored its right counterpart to a large degree. Again, caudal, central and rostral modules reflected a cognitive-motor gradient and a premotor eye-field was found in the ventral part of the left PMd. In addition, a distinct module linked to abstract cognitive functions was observed in the rostro-ventral left PMd across all CBP modalities, implying greater differentiation of higher cognitive functions for the left than the right PMd.',\n",

To manage the organic waste from small cassava industry in Brazil, a waste-water-energy-food nexus (WWEF) system is proposed, combining AD and co-generation or combined heat and power (CHP) plants. However, the environmental impacts and benefits of this system are yet not known. By using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, environmental impacts of three scenarios are assessed, i.e. business-as-usual (base), improved business-as-usual and WWEF closed-loop. Functional unit (FU) in this study is defined as generating 1\\xa0kg cassava starch/flour. Global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (CED), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEP), terrestrial acidification potential (TAP) and water depletion potential (WDP) are selected. Landfilling cassava waste, power use for cassava starch and flour production, and emissions from fertilizer application are identified as environmental hotspots for business-as-usual case, suggesting making decisions on these aspects when dealing with environmental impacts. By using cassava waste to recover energy and nutrients for Brazilian rural family farming, the WWEF system is identified as the best environment-friendly scenario with lowest environmental impacts for the selected impact categories. The impact savings of the closed-loop scenario for GWP are over 90%, while over 50% of emissions for other selected impact categories, except FEP (lower than 10%), are saved compared to the business-as-usual and improved scenarios.

METHODS A questionnaire was sent using the REDCap electronic data capture tool to all 1264 optometrists registered with NHS Education for Scotland (NES). The questionnaire evaluated year of qualification, previous pachymetry training, confidence performing and interpreting pachymetry, and perceived indications for and barriers to use. RESULTS Respondents numbered 418 out of 1264 (33%) optometrists, of whom 56% had previous training in pachymetry. Those that had previous training were significantly more likely to report pachymetry to be useful, with median (inter-quartile range) usefulness score of 86 (71-98) where 0 indicated not at all useful, and 100 extremely useful, vs 76 (58-90), Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, z\\xa0=\\xa0-4.67, p\\xa0<\\xa00.01.

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction Developing \"sustainable buildings\" has become a central goal for national and local policies as part of efforts to reduce energy consumption and to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. While numerous viable technical solutions already exist, the main challenge currently is to implement them in the built environment (Guy, 2006). Sustainable buildings have traditionally been \"niche\" products and have been introduced in protected contexts (Rip & Kemp, 1998); they have rarely matured for wider market dissemination. Previous development of sustainable buildings in Denmark has involved a changing range of concepts over time (Gram-Hanssen & Jensen, 2005; Jensen & Gram-Hanssen, 2007).The different configurations in terms of planning, \"hardware\" technologies, infrastructure, facilities, financing, and social ideals include the following:* Green buildings as energy-saving devices: After the oil crisis of 1973, science-based efforts were made in Denmark to develop technologies to improve the energy performance of buildings and regulations were introduced for implementing these technologies.* Grassroots ecocommunities: A number of alternative and green rural settlements emerged in Denmark in the 1980s and 1990s emphasizing community, self-sufficiency, alternative technologies and lifestyles, and spirituality.* Subsidized urban projects: Commitment to the Brundtland Report created a public drive for green buildings in the 1980s and 1990s that was aimed at testing, approving, and institutionalizing green technologies on the basis of extensive public funding. Danish projects included sustainable renovation under the Urban Renewal Act, as well as sustainable building projects in the social housing sector.A similar typology of sustainable buildings can be found in other countries, such as Germany and Austria (see, e.g., Rohracher & Ornetzeder, 2002). In recent years, however, there have been several attempts in Denmark to provide sustainable buildings for \"ordinary Danes\"--detached houses that appear traditional and where the sustainability enhancements are not very visible. These new building projects share a number of features in their visions, purposes, imagined users, design, and conceptualization of sustainability, and in many ways differ from earlier sustainable building \"paradigms.\" The new approach has focused on applying low energy standards to \"traditional buildings,\" primarily detached houses in suburban areas, and has devoted little attention to social sustainability. In other words, the buildings are typically established as traditional housing with limited shared responsibilities, facilities, and organization. The aim has been to involve the conventional building sector, encouraging and qualifying it to build sustainable buildings. This development can, in the light of sociotechnical transition theory (Rip & Kemp, 1998; Geels, 2002), be seen as an attempt to accelerate the progression of sustainable buildings from niche-based innovations to established regime-level alternatives. In this process, Danish local authorities (municipalities)--given the role that they have played in initiating and framing many of these development projects--have been very active. This process implies a number of changes and challenges in relation to previous approaches to encourage the construction of sustainable buildings.This article explores challenges to the strategy of mainstreaming sustainable housing in Denmark, but the discussion is likely relevant as well for other contexts. We especially discuss the absence of the social dimension in relation to pursuing the goals of environmental sustainability, asking if it is possible to ignore social sustainability and still legitimately achieve environmentally sustainable buildings. And if not, why not, and how can the mainstreaming approach be improved by, for example, learning from other sustainable building concepts.Methodology This article is based on a recent study of new sustainable building development sites in Denmark. …',\n",

Different inactivation mechanisms have been identified in scCO2 sanitization, such as membrane damage, germination defect, and dipicolinic acid leaks. Moreover, the viral sanitization results showed a complete inactivation of both coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. We did not observe changes in PPE morphology, topographical structure, or material integrity, and in accordance with the WHO recommendation, maintained wettability post-processing. These experiments establish a foundational understanding of critical elements for the decontamination and reuse of PPE in any setting and provide a direction for future research in the field.',\n",

The in vitro cytotoxicity of the aphen and ephen phenanthrolines and their Ru derivatives [(η6-p-cymene)RuCl(κ2-N,N-L)]Cl ([1a]Cl and [2a]Cl, respectively) assessed in tumour cell lines has shown that the free ligands are more active than the organometallic products, with aphen being the most potent specimen. Furthermore, the binding interaction of both [1a]Cl and aphen with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been investigated using a variety of thermodynamic and kinetic techniques. The aphen free ligand intercalates into DNA at low ligand content, whereas [1a]Cl forms with DNA a bifunctional partially intercalated-covalent complex, in which the intercalation constant is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than that of aphen. This finding demonstrates that the covalent binding noticeably weakens the intercalation, a feature presumably related to the higher cytotoxic activity of aphen relative to that of [1a]Cl.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Tobacco smoke is a toxic gas-phase cocktail consisting of a broad range of organics, and free radical intermediates. The formation of smoke from a burning cigarette depends on a series of mechanisms, including generation of products by pyrolysis and combustion, aerosol formation, and physical mass transfer processes. The current study simulates the deposition of particulate matter on the human lung surface by trapping the tobacco smoke particulates in situ on silica gel. To mimic this phenomenon, the cigarette was smoked directly on siliga gel. The surface morphology of smoke condensate trapped on silica gel, and pure silica gel (control) was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was used to explore the presence of free radicals on the particulate matter trapped on silica. Standard procedures for cigarette smoking (ISO 3402:1999) were adopted. The char yields of tobacco cigarette in the temperature range 200–700\\xa0°C was also investigated in an inert atmosphere using a quartz reactor. SEM images showed the surface morphology of pure silica gel was smooth while silica gel on which cigarette smoke was smoked on contained particulates of various sizes. Generally, the particulate size of cigarette smoke adsorbed on silica was found to be 2.47\\xa0±\\xa00.0043\\xa0µm (~PM2.5). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results showed a g-value of 2.0037 typically that of a carbon-centred radical. It is therefore evident from this investigation that cigarette smoke contains surface bound radicals considered harmful to the health of cigarette smokers. The particulate size of tobacco smoke (PM2.5) can impact severely on the lives of the cigarette smoking community because of its near ultrafine nature. This significantly small particulate size in cigarette smoke can be inhaled deeper into the lungs thus causing serious cell injury and possible tumour growth in addition to other grave diseases.',\n",

Two studies tested whether the self-regulation strategy of forming implementation intentions (i.e., planning in advance the when, where, and how of one's goal striving) can be used to regulate mimicry effects. In Study 1, implementation intentions to be non-prejudiced ensured that mimicking increased attraction even for an unlikable person. In Study 2, implementation intentions to be thrifty reduced participants' susceptibility to the persuasive effects of being mimicked. Mere goal intentions to be non-prejudiced and to be thrifty did not suffice to regulate mimicry effects. We conclude that the strategic automaticity accomplished by implementation intentions allows people to intentionally strengthen (Study 1) and weaken (Study 2) mimicry effects in line with their goals.

       "  'abstract': 'This study examines which management methods are the most recent and advanced in managing rejected brine generated from desalination plants. It also provides up-to-date information regarding the most adequate technologies that generate a minimum quantity of rejected brine via the use of minimization techniques and analyzes the method of direct disposal that has lately received noticeable improvements. It further discusses the reuse of discarded brine to recover valuable goods and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Sustainability is an important parameter that needs consideration to achieve uninterrupted operation of the discarded brine management to achieve the least environmental, social, and economic aftermath. To properly deal with any environmental issues related to brine disposal, different methods are implemented so that, in the end, higher water recovery is achievable from the desalination processes, namely brine minimization and rejection technologies (pressure retarded osmosis, microbial desalination cell technology), membrane-based technologies (vibratory shear enhanced processing, forward osmosis, electrodialysis, electrodialysis reverse, and electrodialysis metathesis, pervaporation method, thermal-based technologies (wind-aided intensified evaporation, brine concentrators, ohmic evaporator, membrane distillation, multi-stage flash distillation. This review also critically examined the two conventional approaches commonly used in life cycle assessment (LCA), when evaluating the ecotoxic effect of discarded brine. It intends to discuss the currently available methods and propose an improved method for evaluating the toxicity potential of brine on the aquatic ecosystem originated from seawater desalination plants. The Group-by-Group method takes into consideration the demerits of the two methods of the traditional method of LCA or chemical-specific approach as it provides a more holistic coverage for complicated brine to be disposed of. Recently, attention has been focused on recovering valuable metals from the discharged concentrated brine waste. Certainly, attaining marketable products from the discharged concentrated brine would offer an economic benefit and reducing the whole desalination costs. Ion imprinting polymers have potential applications in metal recovery from brine. Finding selective, more efficient, and less expensive imprinted polymers for extraction/pre-concentration of valuable ions is a vital and challenging task. Lastly, the brine should be seen as a resource and not as a waste to attain sustainability in its management approaches. Hybrid processes would be highly recommended to get the absolute transformation of the discarded brine from desalination processes to more valuable constituents.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of survival after resection.       Methods   A retrospective review of all patients that underwent radical resection of biliary malignancies was performed. Demographics, elevated CA19-9 (>35\\xa0U/ml), treatment and outcome data were collected and compared according to tumour location. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were created and compared using log-rank analysis. Multivariate analysis was undertaken using Cox proportional hazards regression.       Results   Ninety-one patients with biliary malignancies underwent surgical resection between 1992 and 2007. There were 46 (50.5%) extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (EHC), 23 (25.2%) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (IHC) and 22 (24.2%) gallbladder carcinomas (GBC). The median (range) age was 64 (24–92) years. An elevated CA19-9 was recorded in 45 (55%) patients (52% of IHC, 63% of EHC, and 41% of GBC). The overall median (range) survival was 22.5 (0.3–153.3) months. All three groups were similar in terms of age, gender, pre-operative CA 19-9 level, completeness of resection and tumour histopathological characteristics. GBC were associated with the shortest median survival (14.3 months) followed by EHC (24.8 months) and IHC (30.4 months); however, this did not meet statistical significance ( P = 0.971). Only elevated pre-operative CA 19-9 level (>35\\xa0U/ml) was predictive of poor median survival by univariate ( P = 0.003) and multivariate analysis (15.1 months vs. 67.4,   P = 0.047).       Conclusions   Elevated pre-operative CA 19-9 levels were found to be independent predictors of poor survival after attempted resection for biliary tree malignancies. It is recommended that CA19-9 be routinely measured prior resection.',\n",

Bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be purified by two-step method of chromatography on alumina. Carbon isotopic composition of individual aromatic hydrocarbons is affected not only by thermal maturity, but also by organic matter input, depositional environment, and hydrocarbon generation process based on the GC-IRMS analysis of Upper Ordovician, Lower Ordovician, and Cambrian source rocks in different areas in the Tarim Basin, western China. The subgroups of aromatic hydrocarbons as well as individual aromatic compound, such as 1-MP, 9-MP, and 2,6-DMP from Cambrian-Lower Ordovician section show more depleted 13C distribution. The δ13C value difference between Cambrian-Lower Ordovician section and Upper Ordovician source rocks is up to 16.1‰ for subgroups and 14‰ for individual compounds. It can provide strong evidence for oil sourc correlation by combing the δ13C value and biomarker distribution of different oil and source rocks from different strata in the Tarim Basin. Most oils from Tazhong area have geochemical characteristics such as more negative δ13C9-MP value, poor gammacerane, and abundant homohopanes, which indicate that Upper Ordovician source rock is the main source rock. In contrast, oils from Tadong area and some oils from Tazhong area have geochemical characteristics such as high δ13C9-MP value, abundant gammacerane, and poor homohopanes, which suggest that the major contributor is Cambrian-Lower Ordovician source rock.',\n",

This course will equip them with a solid and practical understanding of common CT imaging chain and its major components with emphasis on acquisition physics and hardware, reconstruction, artifacts, image quality, dose, and advanced clinical applications. The core objective is to explain the effects of these major system components on the image quality. This course will not focus on the rapid-changing advanced technologies given the two-hour time limit, but the fundamental principles discussed in this course may facilitate better understanding of those more complicated technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe course will begin with an overview of CT acquisition physics and geometry. X-ray tube and CT detector are important acquisition hardware critical to the overall image quality. Each of these two subsystems consists of several major components. An in-depth description of the function and failure modes of these components will be provided. Examples of artifacts related to these failure modes will be presented: off-focal radiation, tube arcing, heel effect, oil bubble, offset drift effect, cross-talk effect, and bad pixels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fundamentals of CT image reconstruction will first be discussed on an intuitive level. Approaches that do not require rigorous derivation of mathematical formulations will be presented. This is followed by a detailed derivation of the Fourier slice theorem: the foundation of the FBP algorithm. FBP for parallel-beam, fan-beam, and cone-beam geometries will be discussed. To address the issue of radiation dose related to x-ray CT, recent advances in iterative reconstruction, their advantages, and clinical applications will also be described.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the nature of fundamental physics and mathematics, limitations in data acquisition, and non-ideal conditions of major system components, image artifact often arise in the reconstructed images. Because of the limited scope of this course, only major imaging artifacts, their appearance, and possible mitigation and corrections will be discussed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssessment of the performance of a CT scanner is a complicated subject. Procedures to measure common image quality metrics such as high contrast spatial resolution, low contrast detectability, and slice profile will be described. The reason why these metrics used for FBP may not be sufficient for statistical iterative reconstruction will be explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nOptimizing radiation dose requires comprehension of CT dose metrics. This course will briefly describe various dose metrics, and interaction with acquisition parameters and patient habitus.\\r\\n\\r\\nCT is among the most frequently used imaging tools due to its superior image quality, easy to operate, and a broad range of applications.

       "  'abstract': 'Hepatocytes and acinar cells exhibit high-efficiency, fiber-dependent internalization of adenovirus; however, viral capsids have unpredictable immunological effects and are challenging to develop into targeted drug carriers. To exploit this internalization pathway and minimize the use of viral proteins, we developed a simple gene product that self assembles nanoparticles decorated with the knob domain of adenovirus serotype 5 fiber protein. The most significant advantages of this platform include: (i) compatibility with genetic engineering; (ii) no bioconjugate chemistry is required to link fusion proteins to the nanoparticle surface; and (iii) it can direct the reversible assembly of large nanoparticles, which are monodisperse, multivalent, and biodegradable. These particles are predominantly composed from diblock copolymers of elastin-like polypeptide (ELP). ELPs have unique phase transition behavior, whereby they self-assemble above a transition temperature that is simple to control. The diblock ELP described contains two motifs with distinct transition temperatures, which assemble nanoparticles at physiological temperatures. Analysis by non-denaturing-PAGE demonstrated that the purified knob-ELP formed trimers or dimers, which is a property of the native knob/fiber protein. Dynamic light scattering indicated that the diblock copolymer, with or without knob, is able to self assemble into nanoparticles ~40 nm in diameter. To examine the functionality of knob-ELP, their uptake was assessed in a hepatocyte cell-line that expresses the receptor for adenovirus serotype 5 fiber and knob, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). Both plain ELP and knob-ELP were bound to the outside of hepatocytes; however, the knob-ELP fusion protein exhibits more internalization and localization to lysosomes of hepatocytes. These findings suggest that functional fusion proteins may only minimally influence the assembly temperature and diameter of ELP nanoparticles. These results are a proof-of-principal that large fusion proteins (>10 kDa) can be assembled by diblock ELPs without the need for bioconjugate chemistry, which greatly simplifies the design and evaluation of targeted drug carriers.',\n",

Pleural fluid (PF) and serum IL-18 content was determined using ELISA. IL-18 was injected intrapleurally in mice and pleural inflammation was assessed using pleural lavage.   The highest PF IL-18 levels were observed in parapneumonic PEs and the lowest PF IL-18 levels in patients with exudates of miscellaneous aetiologies and transudates.

But, in the context of theatre, the scenography of pastoral was also constructed as a peaceful, verdant setting that opposed the dangers and marvels of mythological places and characters put into motion by machines. Even though Arcadia was a rather artificial version of a simple garden or forest, it was nevertheless part of a visual tradition that was understood as a possible world. For Philippe Quinault and Jean-Baptiste Lully, the pastoral space was key to harmonizing not only the singing, but also the ever-increasing use of machines and spectacular scene changes of early musical tragedy. Thanks to its familiar topoi, the pastoral setting (evident in didascalies, iconography, and within the verses of Quinault's libretti) ...\",\n",

Eight isolates obtained from diseased rainbow trout and common carp cultured in Poland were analysed. The isolates were identified using API 20 NE system as Acinetobacter sp. Afterwards, they were identified by sequencing 16S rDNA gene fragment. The bacteria were identified as A. johnsonii (two isolates), A. lwoffii (two isolates), A. junii/johnsonii (one isolate), A. calcoaceticus (one isolate), and Acinetobacter sp. (two isolates). The drug resistance of isolates was examined. The majority of the isolates were resistant to ampicilin, amoxicillin, and cephalothin and all demonstrated sensitivity to fluoroquinolones, except of one isolate. Two isolates were selected for the experimental infection of trout and carp to confirm their pathogenicity. Experimentally infected fish showed disease symptoms similar to those observed in fish naturally infected with these bacteria. This is the first report concerning pathogenicity of A. johnsonii for rainbow trout and A. lwoffii for common carp. These bacteria were regarded as emerging opportunistic pathogens of fish farmed in Poland. Acinetobacter strains are commonly known as microorganisms transmitting the antibiotic resistance genes. Therefore, they might have a great impact on the resistance transfer in aquaculture.',\n",

However, few data exist from large, Western cohorts. The study objectives were to evaluate the incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares, clinically significant hepatic events, and HBVr among a national cohort of US veterans with prior exposure to HBV (anti-HBc+) treated with DAAs. We used a national administrative database to identify patients treated with DAAs from January 2014 through November 2016 and obtained clinical and demographic as well as HBV and HCV treatment data. HBVr was defined as an at least 1-log increase in HBV DNA titer. Among 17,779 anti-HBc+ patients, 17,400 were HIV- and 379 were HIV+. Among the HIV- patients, 17,266 (99%) were HBsAg- prior to DAA therapy and 134 were HBsAg+. Among HIV-, HBsAg- patients, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (≥300 IU/ml) were rare and occurred more frequently after treatment completion: 31 cases (   100 IU/L with total bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl occurred in 39 cases (0.3%), most often following DAA completion (n = 35 cases, 3/35 in setting of HCV relapse). Among 31 patients with post-DAA hepatic events without HCV relapse, 10 (32%) were confirmed unrelated to HBVr by HBsAg and/or HBV DNA testing, 1 (3%) confirmed due to HBVr, and 20 (65%) did not have documented HBV-related testing. One additional case of HBsAg- to + seroreversion was identified. Among HBsAg+ DAA recipients, 2/97 (2%), both with cirrhosis, experienced ALT elevations ≥ 300 IU/ml in the setting of HBVr. In conclusion, clinically significant hepatic events and HBVr were rare and much more likely among HBsAg-positive individuals. Anti-HBc + patients should be monitored for ALT flares and HBVr during and possibly for up to 6 months post DAA therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.',\n",

This technique enables tailoring both the macrostructure and microstructure of silver nanowire aerogels (SNWAs) by integrating programmable 3D printing and freeze casting, respectively.

The ultralight SNWAs reach high electrical conductivity of 1.3 S cm−1 and exhibit excellent compressive resilience under 50% compressive strain. Remarkably, the printing methodology also enables tuning aerogel architectures with designed Poisson's ratio (from negative to positive). Moreover, these aerogel architechtures with tunable Poisson's ratio present highly electromechanical stability under high compressive and tensile strain (both strain up to 20% with fully recovery).\",\n",

The results showed that the bioaccumulation ability of Se decreased significantly with increasing the Se application rate, but the Se distribution coefficient remained around 0.9 with no significant influence. The application of 10 µmol . L-1 selenite stimulated the growth of rape seedlings through improving the root physiological characteristics and root morphology significantly, including significantly increasing the production of superoxide radical (O2∙-) rate and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and fungal catalase (CAT) in the root system, which resulted in a reduction of the lipids peroxidation (MDA) content as much as 26.0%, consequently increasing the root activity as much as 17.4%. The promoting degrees of selenite on root morphological parameters were from strong to weak in such a tendency: root volume > total surface area > number of root forks > total root length > number of root tips > average diameter. However, such positive effects had no significant difference with those in treatment with 1 µmol . L-1 selenite, indicating that small amounts (≤ 10 Lmol .

Theoretical and experimental studies have modeled environments where the behaviors of humans, or agents, have been restricted to analyze their social behavior. However, it is important that such studies can be generalized to a less restrictive environment in order to understand human society. Social network games (SNGs) provide a powerful tool for the quantitative study of human behavior using a less restrictive environment than in previous studies. We focused on multilevel selection, one of the theoretical frameworks used to study the evolution of cooperation. The evolution of cooperation by multilevel selection requires that the continual assortment between cooperators and noncooperators is generated; thus, humans may have acquired mechanisms that ensure assortment (e.g., migration between groups). This study aims to investigate this mechanism in a less restrictive environment. For this purpose, we researched the effect of migration based on data analysis in an SNG where the players could behave more freely than was possible in the environments used in the previous studies. We showed that players maintained assortment between cooperators and defectors in this SNG, where it appears that environmentally driven migration generated the assortment.',\n",

RESULTS Muscle strength improved by 25% to 30% (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01), QOL by 10% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.04), chair stand time by 15% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.01), 6-minute walk distance by 4% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.03), and fatigue decreased by 58% (P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01), fasting insulin by 18% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.04), and diastolic and systolic blood pressure by approximately 5% (P\\u200a=\\u200a0.04) after RT. BCS with the worst fatigue and QOL demonstrated the greatest improvements (absolute change vs baseline: fatigue: r\\u200a=\\u200a-0.95, P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01; QOL: r\\u200a=\\u200a-0.82, P\\u200a<\\u200a0.01). RT was associated with an approximately 25% to 35% relative reduction in plasma and adipose tissue protein levels of proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-6sR, serum amyloid A, and tumor necrosis factor-α, and 75% relative increase in muscle pro-proliferative, angiogenic IL-8 protein content by 75% (all P\\u200a<\\u200a0.05). BCS with the highest baseline proinflammatory cytokine levels had the greatest absolute reductions, and the change in muscle IL-8 correlated directly with improvements in leg press strength (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.53, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.04). CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results suggest that a progressive RT program effectively lowers plasma and tissue-specific inflammation, and that these changes are associated with reductions in fatigue and improved physical and behavioral function in postmenopausal BCS.',\n",

No effective medical treatments are currently available. A unique feature of PSC is its close association (about 80%) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), mainly ulcerative colitis (UC). As in many chronic inflammatory conditions, cancer development can complicate PSC, accounting for >40% of deaths. Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) have been variably associated to PSC, with a prevalence up to 13-14%. The risk of cancer is one of the most challenging issues in the management of PSC; it raises several questions about cancer surveillance, early diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Key Messages: Among the different cancers complicating PSC, CCA is the most relevant, because it is more frequent (incidence of 0.5-1.5%) and because the prognosis is poor (5-year survival Conclusions: PSC may be regarded as paradigmatic of the sequence leading from chronic inflammatory epithelial damage to neoplastic transformation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating this pathogenetic sequence, may improve strategies of disease surveillance and cancer prevention and treatment. PSC is a chronic inflammatory cholangiopathy of unknown etiology but likely immune-mediated, characterized by peribiliary inflammation and fibrosis leading to strictures in any portion (intra- and/or extrahepatic) of the bile duct system. No effective medical treatments are currently available. A unique feature of PSC is the close association (about 80%) with IBD, mainly UC, often diagnosed before PSC (PSC/UC).

       "  'abstract': 'We propose an all-Ethernet end-to-end communication framework for the access, metro and core networks called Omnipresent Ethernet (or OEthernet). The proposed hierarchy is based on two inherent assumptions: (1) present manner of interconnection in carrier networks from a graph theory perspective and (2) recent advances in Carrier Ethernet. The OEthernet approach makes good use of the advances of Ethernet from the LAN to the MAN and now to carrier networks, while inducing pragmatic traffic requirements for end-to-end communication. The OEthernet concept is a new end-to-end communication paradigm focused in particular to meet emerging service needs taking business requirements into consideration. The proposed solution is based on concepts of binary routing, source routing, logical topology abstraction and tagged connection oriented flow provisioning leading to a new communication hierarchy that facilitates end-to-end communication. This end-to-end solution uses Ethernet and its associated advances as an enabler technology. We define the advantages, the technological choices and the traffic assumptions for this end-to-end Ethernetworking hierarchy. Following which we postulate simple algorithms for converting an arbitrary network to one which facilitates source routing and binary routing-two concepts that are instructive in our solution. Subsequent to the conceptual explanation the engineering aspects of the implementation are detailed. In particular end-to-end communication using our solution, in the presence and absence of IP as a network layer is showcased. The solution is analyzed from a utilization and delay perspective. An optical implementation of the end-to-end OEthernet solution for enterprise networks is also proposed. Included is a new node architecture leading to a class of optical networking called O-BiS or Optical Bit-Switching. Comparison with existing approaches as well as positioning with respect to all-IP networks is then showcased. Triple Play services are simulated over our networking solution to validate our results.',\n",

Therapeutic approaches focus mainly on fracture patterns, so ligaments are often neglected. When they rupture along with the bone after pelvic ring fractures, disrupting stability, ligaments need to be considered during reconstruction and rehabilitation. Our aim was to determine the influence of ligaments on open-book injury using two experimental models with body donors. Mechanisms of bone avulsion related to open-book injury were investigated. Open-book injuries were induced in human pelves and subsequently investigated by anatomical dissection and endoscopy. The findings were compared to CT and MRI scans of open-book injuries. Relevant structures were further analyzed using plastinated cross-sections of the posterior pelvic ring. A fragment of the distal sacrum was observed, related to open-book injury. Two ligaments were found to be responsible for this avulsion phenomenon: the caudal portion of the anterior sacroiliac ligament and another ligament running along the ventral surface of the third sacral vertebra. The sacral fragment remained attached to the coxal bone by this second ligament after open-book injury. These results were validated using plastination and the structures were identified. Pelvic ligaments are probably involved in sacral avulsion caused by lateral traction. Therefore, ligaments should to be taken into account in diagnosis of open-book injury and subsequent therapy.

Methods   This population-based register-study included Danish women aged 23–59\\xa0years and diagnosed with CC in 2001–2005. Women with a cervical screening outcome were used as comparison group. We obtained number of contacts to general practitioners (GPs), hospitals, psychologists/psychiatrists and defined daily doses (DDD) of analgesic/psychotropic prescription drugs. A difference-in-differences-design was used to estimate effect of a CC diagnosis on health-care use from five-year periods before and after the diagnosis/screening outcome.       Results   In total, 926 women with CC and 1,004,759 women without cancer were included. In five years following the date of CC diagnosis, CC patients had increased their use of GPs with 8.6 (95% CI 4.8–12.4) contacts more than women in the comparison group, and with 4.12 (95% CI 3.99–4.25) more hospital contacts. In contrast, use of psychologists/psychiatrists was low and largely unaffected by the CC diagnosis. For use of prescription drugs, analgesics increased with 80 (95% CI 60–100) DDD more in CC patients than in comparison women, and for psychotropics with 304 (95% CI 261–347) DDD more.       Conclusions   A CC diagnosis was followed by an increase in use of GPs, hospitals, and analgesic/psychotropic prescription drugs, while use of psychologist/psychiatrist was largely unaffected. This pattern may indicate that pain/mental health concerns after CC either persisted or were alleviated by other means only.',\n",

Typically, the first and most salient characteristic of AD is episodic memory impairment. A few patients, however, present with focal cortical, non-memory symptoms, such as difficulties with language, visuospatial, or executive functions. These presentations are associated with specific patterns of atrophy and frequently with a young age at onset. Age is not, however, the only determinant of phenotype; underlying factors, especially genetic factors, seem also to affect phenotype and predispose patients to younger or older age at onset. Importantly, patients with atypical early-onset disease seldom carry the APOE ɛ4 allele, which is the most important risk factor for lowering the age of onset in patients with AD. Additionally, theAPOE ɛ4 genotype seems to predispose patients to vulnerability in the medial temporal areas, which leads to memory loss. Conversely, patients negative for the APOE ɛ4 allele and with early-onset AD are more likely to be predisposed to vulnerability of cerebral networks beyond the medial temporal lobes. Other factors are probably involved in determining the pattern of atrophy, but these are currently unknown.\",\n",

Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) routinely performed for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) can also identify coronary artery calcifications (CAC). We evaluated the frequency and outcomes of incorporating CAC into the CHA2DS2-VASc score in AF patients undergoing PVI.   Methods and results   Consecutive patients in a prospective PVI registry during 2014-18 having CCT within 1 year of PVI were studied. Reclassification of CHA2DS2-VASc score and associations between CAC as a binary variable detected on CCT with clinical characteristics, stroke as primary endpoint, death, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were analysed. Amongst 3604 AF patients, 2238 (62.1%) had CAC detected on CCT and was associated with most traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Coronary artery calcification was independently associated with all pre-specified endpoints adjusting for clinical parameters in multivariable analysis. Adjusting for CHA2DS2-VASc score, CAC was associated with stroke (hazards ratio 3.64, 95% confidence interval 1.25-10.6, P = 0.018), death (2.26, 1.29-3.98, P = 0.006), and MACE (2.08, 1.36-3.16, P = 0.001) during 2.8 ± 1.6-year follow-up.

HRMS of each peak produced 1-14 fragments with different m/z values. Two of these fragments were identified as 19'-hydroxyfucoxanthinol and 8'-apoalloxanthinal, which are the carotenoids found in aquatic microalgae.\",\n",

High-step-coverage copper (Cu)-lateral interconnects formed over 100??m thick Si chips by the electroplating method have been investigated for their microstructure and electrical characteristics, using the field emission scanning electron microscope and semiconductor parameter analyzer (Agilent, 4156C). The obtained coverage ratios (i.e. the layer thickness on the chip surface to the sidewall of the chip) for each formed layer, i.e. the tantalum barrier layer, Cu seed layer, SiO2?dielectric layer and electroplated Cu layer, were 3:1, 3:1, 1.5:1 and 1:1, respectively. The measured mean electrical resistances for 36??m???2000??m and 58??m???2000??m interconnect lines were respectively 31.1 and 24?m?, and the difference between measured and calculated resistance values was less than 5%. The good quality of as-fabricated Cu-lateral interconnects was evidenced from the observed low resistance values for isolated interconnects and the linear change in daisy chain resistance with the number of interconnects. More importantly, even at a high operating temperature of 150??C, the resistance value of the Cu-lateral interconnect over the integrated chip was very close to that of the resistance value of interconnect on the plain wafer. The suitability of this technique in integrating various chips heterogeneously was validated from the no observed change in transistor behavior due to this technique. Since this is a CMOS compatible interconnection method between the polymer substrate and chip, it can readily be scaled up to the wafer level.',\n",

Theoretical results indicate that for phenol and toluene, OH radical preferentially attack the ortho C atom due to the functional group on the benzene ring. But for naphthalene, OH radical preferentially attack the para-position C atoms because of its inherent benzo structure. To further study of the kinetics, the rate constant was calculated by the transition state theory. The comparison shows that the theoretical reaction rate constants for the degradation of tar by the OH radical were consistent with those obtained from literature experiments. And the rate constant of destructing naphthalene by OH radical was larger than that of destructing toluene, but lower than that of destructing phenol. The degradation sequence of OH radical to tar is: phenol\\xa0\\u200b>\\xa0\\u200bnaphthalene\\xa0\\u200b>\\xa0\\u200btoluene. Because of the activation of hydroxyl group in benzene ring, phenol is the most easily attacked and destroyed by OH radical. The theoretical results can provide theoretical basis and data reference for further research on the removal of biomass tar and aromatics by OH radical.',\n",

We aimed to describe the histopathological changes in the surgical specimens from patients with clinical signs of pituitary disease that fulfilled the current diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RH. Histopathological features were correlated with clinical and radiological findings. Of 19 patients with pituitary dysfunction and inflammatory changes in the surgical pituitary specimen operated on during 2011-2019, we identified five patients with typical IgG4-related pathology (lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with more than 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells per one high power microscopic field, representing at least 40% of all plasma cells and at least focal storiform fibrosis). One patient with diabetes insipidus and pachymeningitis with IgG4-related changes in a biopsy from the dura was also included. Additional histopathological changes that typically are not part of the IgG4-RH were observed: Rathke's cleft cyst in four and granulomatous changes in two patients. One patient had an elevated serum IgG4 level and systemic manifestations that could be associated with the systemic IgG4-RD. Our findings indicate that pure IgG4-RH is uncommon. All patients with pituitary dysfunction, beyond typical IgG4-related pathology, had other pathological findings that could trigger the secondary IgG4-response. Both primary pathology and secondary IgG4-related features should be reported in patients with pituitary dysfunction because their co-occurrence may cause atypical clinical and imaging features, and unexpected response to surgical and pharmacological treatment. The current criteria for the diagnosis of IgG4-RH can lead to overdiagnosis of IgG4-RH if additional pathological changes are not taken into consideration. The classification criteria of IgG4-RD proposed by the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism could help classify patients more properly as IgG4-RH if applied to the pituitary gland.\",\n",

When performing qualitative studies, researchers must demonstrate the trustworthiness of their analysis so researchers and practitioners consuming their work can understand if and how the presented research claims and conclusions might be transferable to their unique educational settings. There are a number of steps researchers can take to demonstrate the trustworthiness of their work, one of which is demonstrating and reporting evidence of reliability. The purpose of this methodological review is to investigate the methods researchers use to establish and report reliability for chemistry education research articles including a qualitative research component. Drawing from the literature on qualitative research methodology and content analysis, we describe the approaches for establishing the reliability of qualitative data analysis using various measures of inter-rater reliability and processes including negotiated agreement. We used this background literature to guide our review of research articles containing a qualitative component and published in Chemistry Education Research and Practice and the Journal of Chemical Education from the years 2010 through 2019 for whether they report evidence of reliability. We followed this by a more in-depth analysis of how articles from the years 2017 through 2019 discuss reliability. Our analysis indicates that, overall, researchers are presenting evidence of reliability in chemistry education research (CER) articles by reporting reliability measures, describing a process of negotiated agreement, or mentioning reliability and the steps taken to demonstrate it. However, there is a reliance on reporting only percent agreement, which is not considered an acceptable measure of reliability when used on its own. In addition, the descriptions of how reliability was established were not always clear, which may make it difficult for readers to evaluate the veracity of research findings. Our findings indicate that, as a field, CER researchers should be more cognizant of the appropriateness of how we establish reliability for qualitative analysis and should more clearly present the processes by which reliability was established in CER manuscripts.',\n",

Development of ABT-736 for Alzheimer's disease was discontinued due to severe adverse effects (AEs) observed in cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies. The acute nature of AEs observed only at the highest doses suggested potential binding of ABT-736 to an abundant plasma protein. Follow-up investigations indicated polyspecificity of ABT-736, including unintended high-affinity binding to monkey and human plasma protein platelet factor 4 (PF-4), known to be involved in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in humans. The chronic AEs observed at the lower doses after repeat administration in monkeys were consistent with HIT pathology. Screening for a backup antibody revealed that ABT-736 possessed additional unintended binding characteristics to other, unknown factors. A subsequently implemented screening funnel focused on nonspecific binding led to the identification of h4D10, a high-affinity Aβ oligomer binding antibody that did not bind PF-4 or other unintended targets and had no AEs in vivo. This strengthened the hypothesis that ABT-736 toxicity was not Aβ target-related, but instead was the consequence of polyspecificity including PF-4 binding, which likely mediated the acute and chronic AEs and the HIT-like pathology. In conclusion, thorough screening of antibody candidates for nonspecific interactions with unrelated molecules at early stages of discovery can eliminate candidates with polyspecificity and reduce potential for toxicity caused by off-target binding.\",\n",

Here, we conducted a comprehensive study on the quantitative exposure and risk characterization of these priority toxicants in mainstream cigarette smoke listed by the WHO TobReg. The human-smoked toxicant yields estimated from spent cigarette butts of a total of 361 smokers using the part-filter method (PFM) were applied to current exposure and risk estimation for the first time. The PFM can estimate human-smoked yields of toxicants using smokers' maximum mouth-level exposure. The human-smoked yield of each toxicant was converted to systemic uptake by considering bioavailability. Risk indicators-including the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), cumulative ILCR, hazard quotient (HQ), hazard indices (HIs), and margin of exposure (MOE)-were estimated from the systemic uptake of toxicants combined with Korean exposure factors by gender and age group as well as for total smokers. It was demonstrated that cigarette smoking results in significant cancer and non-cancer health risks. A sensitivity analysis showed that the human-smoked toxicant yield is one of the most important contributors to risk level variations. Our risk estimation suggested that previous risk assessments might have ignored or underestimated the uncertainty of risk assessment. In conclusion, we assessed the risk level of the 38 toxicants on the priority list developed by the WHO TobReg and provided a Korean-specific priority list for the regulations on the emission of cigarette smoke.\",\n",

Data was analyzed by PROC GLIMMIX, SAS. Control cows had lower conception at C1 (5.7%c , 7/123) than treated (30.4%b , 35/115) and treated+eCG (51.8%a , 58/112; P=0.001). One cycle later (C2) there was an increase on conception of all groups, but the difference between them was kept: 17.1%c (21/123), 42.6%b (49/115), 58.9%a (66/112); P=0.001. Similar effect occurred at C3 [27.6% (34/123)c , 52.2% (60/115)b and 70.4% (79/112)a ; P=0.001] and C4 [42.3% (52/123)c , 58.3% (67/115)b and 74.1% (83/112)a ; P=0.001]. Only at C5 control cows got closer to treated, but treated+eCG kept higher conception: 65.0% (80/123)b , 68.7% (79/115)ab and 82.1% (92/112)a ; P=0.01. Thus, it was shown that (1) PP acyclicity is an important villain of reproductive efficiency of primiparous cows kept on pasture and that (2) treatment with TAI-like protocols is crucial to improve and accelerate PP conception. Also, the use of eCG potentially increased PP conception by allowing more than half of cows to conceive at the first PP service, which is higher than 5.7% and 30.4% found for control and treated cows without eCG. The velocity of PP conception is crucial to achieve 12m interval between parturitions and maximum herd reproductive efficiency. Thus, the use of TAI-like protocols associated with eCG can anticipate PP cyclicity and is a potential tool to improve conception of primiparous cows exposed to bulls, with impact until the end of the BS.',\n",

This study examined the prevalence of infections due to 4 CR Gram-negative species (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) in the United States and assessed their impact on hospital stays and mortality.   Methods   Hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed infection due to any of the 4 Gram-negative pathogens were identified from the Premier Healthcare Database. Proportions of CR were calculated by pathogen and infection site (blood, respiratory, urinary, or other) for the United States as whole and by census regions. Crude and adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital mortality were produced using logistic regression.   Results   From 2009 to 2013, 13 262 (4.5%) of 292 742 infections due to these 4 Gram-negative pathogens were CR. Of these CR infections, 82.3% were caused by A. baumannii (22%) or P. aeruginosa (60.3%), while 17.7% were caused by K. pneumoniae or E. coli. CR patients had longer hospital stays than carbapenem-susceptible (CS) patients in all pathogen-infection site cohorts, except in the A. baumannii-respiratory cohort. The crude all cause in-hospital mortality was greater for most pathogen-infection site cohorts of the CR group compared with the CS group, especially for A. baumannii infection in the blood (crude odds ratio [OR], 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.69-5.70). This difference for the A. baumannii-blood cohort remained after adjusting for the relevant covariates (adjusted OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.43-4.22).   Conclusion   The majority of CR infections and disease burden in the United States was caused by nonfermenters A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Patients with CR infections had longer hospital stays and higher crude in-hospital mortality.',\n",

Identifying and describing ‘such experiences’ could facilitate better parental support from the paediatric intensive care team and help the parents manage a stressful situation. Aims: This study aimed to describe parents' experiences of having their child admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 12 parents whose children had been admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit. A qualitative design was used, and the interviews were analysed based on content analysis. Result: The analysis revealed two categories: ‘being involved’ and ‘being informed’ with seven subcategories: ‘caring for the parents’, ‘security and trust’, ‘altering the parental role’, ‘stress and fear’, ‘the importance of knowing’, ‘interaction in the care process’ and ‘being prepared’. An overarching theme emerged: the experience was ‘like being in another world’. The study concludes that a child's admission to a paediatric intensive care unit is a stressful situation, and for the parents to be able to handle the anxiety and stress, they need to be informed of and involved in their child's care. Conclusions: The parents' experience when their child is admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit is fraught with a range of emotion and fear. There are indications that things such as good information, involvement and a positive experience of the transfer to the paediatric ward reduce the stress and anxiety associated with paediatric intensive care admission. The result of this study could be used as a basis for a post-paediatric intensive care follow-up service for the children and their families.\",\n",

A number of studies demonstrate the involvement of chronic systemic inflammation to the pathogenesis and progression of metabolic syndrome (type 2 diabetes mellitus with obesity and arterial hypertension) in patients with osteoarthritis. Its exacerbation associated with polymorbidity leads to a violation of the microcirculation, structure of collagen and promotes the degenerative process in the articular tissues, where the protein of the extracellular matrix matrilin-3 plays a role. It is proved to be associated with the level of the corresponding genotypes of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. The purpose of the study was to study changes in the genotypes of genes of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10   (IL-10, C592A)   provoked by the treatment in patients with osteoarthritis combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension.     Materials and methods.     One hundred and sixteen patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and arterial hypertension aged 16 to 65 years (mean age 40.5 years) were examined. To analyze the effectiveness of treatment depending on the genotype of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10   (IL-10, C592A)   the surveyed patients were divided into groups depending on those genotypes.     Results.     Due to the treatment, lipid peroxidation activity significantly decreased (more effective in carriers of the C-allele of the IL-10 gene   (C592A) ) against the background of not significant increase in antioxidant protection, which did not correlate with polymorphous variants of the IL-10 gene (rs1800872). The concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 reduced by 25.6\\xa0% in the   CC -genotype carriers, in   CA -genotype carriers — by 18.58\\xa0%, in   AA -genotype patients — by 15.37\\xa0% (p\\xa0> 0.05). And the level of anti-inflammatory IL-10, on the contrary, increased by 11.69, 18.0 and 23.08\\xa0%, respectively (p > 0.05). A slight increase in the extracellular matrix protein matrilin-3 was established in the   CC -genotype carriers by 4.4\\xa0%, in the CA-genotype patients — by 13.5\\xa0%, and in the carriers of   AA -genotype of the gene of   IL-10 (C592A)   — by 13.8\\xa0% (p\\xa0> 0.05).     Conclusions.     The results of the treatment demonstrated a decrease in the activity of the lipid peroxidation (more effective in carriers of the C-allele of the IL-10 gene   (C592A) ) against the background of not significant increase in antioxidant protection, which did not correlate with polymorphous variants of the IL-10 gene (rs1800872). The therapy resulted in great reduction of the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-18 in   CC -genotype and   CA -genotype patients, and increase in the level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in carriers of the AA-genotype of the gene   IL-10 (C592A) . These patients experienced the improvement in matrilin-3 indices.

Turkey has a very high potential for renewable energy, and the Turkish government has made significant reforms for solar energy investments over the last decade. Site selection for solar power plants is a critical issue for large investments because of quality of terrain, local weathering factors, proximity to high transmission capacity lines, agricultural facilities and environmental conservation issues. Multi-criteria evaluation is a tool that allows one to choose the best criterion among multiple and offer a structure with a wide range of applications. In this paper, the ideal locations for solar power plant were selected using the geographic information system and analytic hierarchy process which is one of the multi-criteria evaluation methods.

Despite distinctive decline seen in the number of VL cases in ISC, there is still a quest for development of a diagnostic test which has the utility for detection of active infection and relapse cases and as a test of cure. The present study validated the sensitivity and specificity of SYBR Green I based closed tube LAMP assay reported by us for diagnosis of VL.     Methodology The validation study was carried out at two endemic sites in India, located at Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna and Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS), Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi. Standard operating protocols were provided at the two sites for applying LAMP assay on confirmed VL cases. The diagnostic accuracy of LAMP assay was evaluated by Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. Furthermore, a simplified LAMP assay based on direct blood lysis, DBL-LAMP, was developed and verified for its diagnostic accuracy.     Principal findings A total of 267 eligible participants were included in the study which comprised of 179 VL cases and 88 controls. Sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assay were 98.32% (95% C.I– 95.2–99.7%) and 96.59% (95% C.I.-90.4–99.3%), respectively. ROC curve analysis depicted no significant difference between area under curve (AUCROC) for LAMP assay and rK39 RDT, indicative of LAMP as an excellent diagnostic test. DBL-LAMP assay, performed on 67 VL and 100 control samples, yielded a sensitivity of 93.05% (95% C.I- 84.75–97%) and specificity of 100% (95% C.I.- 96.30–100%).     Conclusions/Significance The validated closed tube LAMP for diagnosis of VL will provide impetus to the ongoing VL elimination programme in ISC. The assay based on direct blood lysis promotes its scope for application in field settings by further reducing time and cost.',\n",

In this paper, we study the vanishing properties of these functions on hypersurfaces of ℙn × ℙn. In particular, we show that very general hypersurfaces of bidegree (k, k) obey a very strong vanishing property, which we define as asymptotic purity: at most one asymptotic cohomological function is nonzero for each divisor.

       "  'abstract': 'A mapping-based tree similarity algorithm is proposed for matching concept trees in ontology alignment to integrate various information sources in the Semantic Web. Concepts regarding classes and properties are the most critical ontological elements and metadata. First, the similarity between the individual concepts of each type is defined. These concept systems, which are considered as the foundation of ontology, are described as tree modes for overall comparison. Based on the minimal cost of edit operations, previous tree similarity measuring approaches are extremely complicated because three or four edit operations are involved. Moreover, such approaches ignore the similarity among single nodes. In the proposed algorithm, node similarity, instead of changing operation, is adopted and the inserting and deleting operation is omitted. The proposed algorithm is more concise and effective because it satisfies the maximum mapping theorem without damaging tree isomorphism. The algorithm is resolved and realized by a dynamic programming scheme. Then, the algorithm is independently used to compare class and property trees, and their mapping concept sets are regarded as the main part of the ontology alignment. Demonstration examples are used to prove the effectiveness and feasibility of the algorithm in ontology alignment.',\n",

The CFP oils gave high carbon yields of >95%, consumed less hydrogen per gram of oil produced, and had lower final oxygen concentrations than the raw oils did.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Multi-Atlas based Segmentation (MAS) algorithms have been successfully applied to many medical image segmentation tasks, but their success relies on a large number of atlases and good image registration performance. Choosing well-registered atlases for label fusion is vital for an accurate segmentation. This choice becomes even more crucial when the segmentation involves organs characterized by a high anatomical and pathological variability. In this paper, we propose a new genetic atlas selection strategy (GAS) that automatically chooses the best subset of atlases to be used for segmenting the target image, on the basis of both image similarity and segmentation overlap. More precisely, the key idea of GAS is that if two images are similar, the performances of an atlas for segmenting each image are similar. Since the ground truth of each atlas is known, GAS first selects a predefined number of similar images to the target, then, for each one of them, finds a near-optimal subset of atlases by means of a genetic algorithm. All these near-optimal subsets are then combined and used to segment the target image. GAS was tested on single-label and multi-label segmentation problems. In the first case, we considered the segmentation of both the whole prostate and of the left ventricle of the heart from magnetic resonance images. Regarding multi-label problems, the zonal segmentation of the prostate into peripheral and transition zone was considered. The results showed that the performance of MAS algorithms statistically improved when GAS is used.',\n",

Based on the equations, a power compensation control strategy of VSC-HVDC is proposed via the passivity-based control with disturbance observer to suppress both the current-relevant and voltage-relevant components in the power ripples.

The drop settles to a quasi-steady state in a relaxation time that is set by the viscosities of the drop and the ambient fluid and the surface tension, and oscillates around a mean deformation with a frequency that is twice the electric field frequency. The mode of instantaneous deformation remains the same (oblate or prolate) or switches between oblate and prolate, depending on the relative importance of the time-periodic component of the deformation compared to that of the time-exponential. The structure of the flow field and its evolution is studied for representative fluid systems at a high and a low electric field frequency. The individual contribution of the net tangential and normal electric stresses, which are the driving forces of the problem, on the flow structure and drop deformation is characterized. On the basis of the mean (time-independent) and time-periodic components of the driving forces, the flow field is represented as the superposition of three different flow patterns. It is shown that the interplay of these flow patterns leads to formation and destruction of toroidal vortices, and that the residence time of these vortices correlates inversely with the field frequency.',\n",

Although several studies have shown the impact of high ethanol intake on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression, few have addressed the relationship between the patterns of gene expression underlying the compulsive behaviour associated with relapsing. In this study, we used a chronic three-bottle free-choice mouse model to investigate the PFC transcriptome in three different groups of mice drinkers: 'Light drinkers' (preference for water throughout the experiment); 'Heavy drinkers' (preference for ethanol with a non-compulsive intake), and 'Inflexible drinkers' (preference for ethanol with a compulsive drinking component). Our aim was to correlate the intake patterns observed in this model with gene expression changes in the PFC, a brain region critical for the development and maintenance of alcohol addiction. We found that the Camk2a gene showed a downregulated profile only in the Inflexible when compared to the Light drinkers group, the Camk2n1 and Pkp2 genes showed an upregulated profile only in the Inflexible drinkers when compared to the Control group, and the Gja1 gene showed an upregulated profile in the Light and Inflexible drinkers when compared to the Control group. These different transcription patterns have been associated to the presence of alcohol, in the Camk2n1 and Gja1 genes; to the amount of ethanol consumed, in the Camk2a gene; and to the loss of control in the alcohol consumption, in the Pkp2 gene. Here, we provide, for the first time, the potential involvement of the Pkp2 gene in the compulsivity and loss of control over the voluntary ethanol consumption.\",\n",

In this study, genetic polymorphism of three mangrove species, Xylocarpus granatum, Excoecaria agallocha, and Phoenix paludosa, was assessed using RAPD and ISSR molecular markers.

Relatively higher genetic polymorphism was recorded for the profusely growing E. agallocha and P. paludosa: 24.66 and 26.4% in RAPD; 24.87 and 20.32% in ISSR analysis respectively. A UPGMA dendrogram constructed using the similarity matrix from RAPD, ISSR and combined data showed that for X. granatum, the least and highest salinity zones clustered together, whereas for E. agallocha and P. paludosa, higher and lower salinity areas clustered in different clades. Nei’s genetic diversity, calculated from RAPD and ISSR data, was also in accordance with 0.0637 and 0.0583 for X. granatum, respectively, much lower than 0.0794 and 0.0818 for E. agallocha and 0.0799 and 0.0688 for P. paludosa.

In other words, we show that, at least in the context of Bianchi I cosmologies, the Einstein frame is available only when the original formulation in the Jordan frame is free of anisotropic singularities. Furthermore, we present a novel dynamical system formulation for anisotropic cosmologies in which both frames, provided they exist, will be manifestly equivalent from the dynamical point of view, even though they fail to be diffeomorphic in general.

METHODS: Fifty patients were enrolled who had received a maximum of 2 previous regimens, including 1 cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)/CHOP-like regimen but no previous exposure to rituximab, fludarabine, or mitoxantrone. At baseline, 58% of patients had bulky disease (lesion > 7 cm), 56% had high-risk Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) scores (range, 3-5), and 22% were refractory. Treatment consisted of 4 courses of R-FM (rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 1, fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) intravenously on Days 2 through 4, and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 2, recycling at Day 28) and consolidation with 2 courses of fludarabine and mitoxantrone (the same regimen without rituximab). RESULTS: The best response (84% overall response rate including 68% complete response/complete response unconfirmed) was achieved after 4 courses of R-FM. Response rates were high regardless of age, refractoriness to last previous therapy, and FLIPI score. After a median follow-up of 4 years, the 3-year progression-free survival rate was 47%, the event-free survival rate was 41%, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 66%. Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia and infections were the most common toxicities and occurred in 72% and 14% of patients, respectively.

However, fasting can elicit hyperphagia in rats, particularly upon access to a calorically dense, high-energy (HE) diet. To examine the effects of ADF on HE diet preference, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive either ad-libitum or alternate day access to both chow and HE food. Meal pattern analysis was conducted to provide a more detailed explanation of changes in HE preference. ADF rats had a decreased preference for the HE diet compared to controls. Both male and female ADF rats increased in overall intake of chow. However, for male ADF rats, the decrease in HE preference was driven by an increase in both size and number of chow meals; for females, it was driven only by an increase in number of chow meals. Meal size is controlled by both positive feedback (e.g., from the oral cavity) and negative feedback (e.g., from postoral inhibitory signals). Thus, for males, fasting appeared to increase orosensory stimulation and/or decrease sensitivity to inhibitory cues towards chow. For females, fasting appeared to decrease sensitivity to inhibitory cues towards chow.

These NPSs may cause serious health problems as their adverse effects are not known in most cases. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the cardiotoxicity of 25I-NBOH and 25C-NBOH using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, rat electrocardiography (ECG), Langendorff test, and human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression levels of p21 CDC42/RAC1-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), which is known to play various roles in the cardiovascular system. In the MTT assay, treatment with 25I-NBOH or 25C-NBOH dramatically decreased viability of H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, these two compounds significantly increased QT intervals and RR intervals in the rat ECG measurement. 25I-NBOH down-regulated the PAK1 protein expression in rat primary cardiomyocytes as well as H9c2 cells. However, 25C-NBOH had no effect on the PAK1 expression in H9c2 cells. In an in-depth study, 25I-NBOH inhibited potassium channels in the hERG assay, but in ex vivo test, the substance did not affect the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and heart rate of the isolated rat hearts. Taken together, these results suggest that both 25I-NBOH and 25C-NBOH may have adverse cardiovascular effect. Further investigation would be needed to determine which factors mainly influence the relationship between PAK1 expression and cardiotoxicity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"In an abstract sense, quantum data hiding is the manifestation of the fact that two classes of quantum measurements can perform very differently in the task of binary quantum state discrimination. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of continuous variable quantum systems. First, we look at the celebrated case of data hiding 'against' the set of local operations and classical communication. While previous studies have placed upper bounds on its maximum efficiency in terms of the local dimension and are thus not applicable to continuous variable systems, we tackle this latter case by establishing more general bounds that rely solely on the local mean photon number of the states employed. Along the way, we perform a quantitative analysis of the error introduced by the non-ideal Braunstein--Kimble quantum teleportation protocol, determining how much two-mode squeezing and local detection efficiency is needed in order to teleport an arbitrary local state of known mean energy with a prescribed accuracy. Finally, following a seminal proposal by Winter, we look at data hiding against the set of Gaussian operations and classical computation, providing the first example of a relatively simple scheme that works with a single mode only. The states employed can be generated from a two-mode squeezed vacuum by local photon counting; the larger the squeezing, the higher the efficiency of the scheme.\",\n",

This framework was created to facilitate studies that would generate high-quality RWE, including pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs), which are randomized trials designed to inform clinical or policy decisions by assessing the real-world effectiveness of an intervention. There is general agreement among experts that the use of existing healthcare and patient-generated data holds promise for making randomized trials more efficient, less costly, and more generalizable. Yet the benefits of relying on real-world data sources must be weighed against difficulties with ensuring data integrity and completeness. Additionally, appropriately monitoring patient safety in randomized trials of new drugs using healthcare system data that might not be available in real time can be quite difficult. Recognizing that these and other concerns are critical to the development and acceptability of PCTs, a group of stakeholders from academia, industry, professional organizations, regulatory bodies, government agencies, and patient advocates discussed a path forward for PCT growth and sustainability at a think tank meeting entitled \"Monitoring and Analyzing Data from Pragmatic Streamlined Randomized Clinical Trials,\" which took place in January 2019 (Washington, DC). The goals of this meeting were to: (1) evaluate study design and methodological options specific to PCTs that have the potential to yield high-quality evidence; (2) discuss best practices to ensure data quality in PCTs; and (3) identify appropriate methods for study monitoring.

With the help of oxygen isotope tracing method, the effects of these two environmental parameters on degradation mechanism of styrene were revealed at atomic level. Increasing styrene concentration favored product formation, which was however inhibited by RH elevation. Gaseous products were not directly formed in gaseous phase, but originated from desorption of interfacial intermediates. The volatile aldehydes and furans further exchanged their 16O with 18O in H218O. Increase of RH showed higher enhancement on 18O distribution in all products and pathways than that of substrate concentration. Low RH preferred high generation of 16O2•- and (16)1O2, dominating reaction to form 1-phenyl-1,2-ethandiol, 2-hydroxy-1-phenyl-ethanon and phenylglyoxal monohydrate in sequence. Successive production of benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid through the reaction of styrene with promoted •18OH by increasing RH became predominant. Hydration was firstly observed and confirmed as an important gaseous transformation step of aldehyde and furan products. Our findings provide a deep insight into photocatalytic degradation mechanism of aromatic hydrocarbons regulated by environmental parameters to further improve their industrial purification efficiency, and are helpful predicting environmental geochemistry fate of organics and preventing their negative impact on natural environment.',\n",

Materials and methods   420 cases were matched with 420 controls for age and ABO blood group.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Deciphering the role of sulfur in biogeochemical cycles strongly relies on its stable isotope composition, which ultimately depends on the ability to quantitatively recover different sulfur species from geological samples. For decades most studies have been restricted to the 34S/32S composition of bulk samples, using simple methods based on the analysis of SO2 released by sample combustion combined to mass spectrometry. The wet chemistry procedures required to selectively extract specific sulfur species were generally avoided due to their tediousness and inefficiency for some complex matrices, especially when targeting organic sulfur. With the recent advent of multi-isotope studies (investigating the minor sulfur stable isotopes 33S and 36S) which rely either on the analysis of sulfur as SF6, or on the use of secondary ion or multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, wet chemistry-based preparation procedures were brought back to the stage with a renewed interest in developing procedures better adapted to the investigation of specific sulfur species.   Here we propose a new stepwise chemical procedure for the quantitative recovery and multi-isotope analysis of organic sulfur from both solvent soluble (total lipid extract) and insoluble (kerogen) fractions, based on a wet oxidation by sodium hypochlorite. This procedure also allows the multi-isotope analysis of inorganic sulfur species (elemental sulfur, sulfates and sulfides) in the same sample. Its application to different well-known petroleum source rocks and to an oil demonstrates its relevance for disentangling the interactions between the different sulfur pools and for shedding new light on the sulfur biogeochemical cycle.',\n",

Methods: We systematically collated data from randomized, controlled trials. cIMT was assessed as the mean value at the common-carotid-artery; if unavailable, the maximum value at the common-carotid-artery or other cIMT measures were used. The primary outcome was a combined CVD end point defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedures, or fatal CVD. We estimated intervention effects on cIMT progression and incident CVD for each trial, before relating the 2 using a Bayesian meta-regression approach. Results: We analyzed data of 119 randomized, controlled trials involving 100 667 patients (mean age 62 years, 42% female). Over an average follow-up of 3.7 years, 12 038 patients developed the combined CVD end point. Across all interventions, each 10 μm/y reduction of cIMT progression resulted in a relative risk for CVD of 0.91 (95% Credible Interval, 0.87-0.94), with an additional relative risk for CVD of 0.92 (0.87-0.97) being achieved independent of cIMT progression. Taken together, we estimated that interventions reducing cIMT progression by 10, 20, 30, or 40 μm/y would yield relative risks of 0.84 (0.75-0.93), 0.76 (0.67-0.85), 0.69 (0.59-0.79), or 0.63 (0.52-0.74), respectively. Results were similar when grouping trials by type of intervention, time of conduct, time to ultrasound follow-up, availability of individual-participant data, primary versus secondary prevention trials, type of cIMT measurement, and proportion of female patients. Conclusions: The extent of intervention effects on cIMT progression predicted the degree of CVD risk reduction. This provides a missing link supporting the usefulness of cIMT progression as a surrogate marker for CVD risk in clinical trials.',\n",

This is especially important when designing systems in which dynamic programming is embedded in a computational cycle that is repeated many times. Therefore, the article analyzes various possibilities of increasing the speed of the dynamic programming algorithm. For some problems, using the Bellman optimality principle, recurrence formulas were obtained for calculating the optimal trajectory without any analysis of the set of options for its construction step by step.

The analysis uses the dileptonic final states of       t       t     ‾         events produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of       41.5           fb       −   1         , recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. A new charm jet identification algorithm provides input to a neural network that is trained to distinguish among       t       t     ‾         events with two additional charm (     t       t     ‾     c       c     ‾       ), bottom (     t       t     ‾     b       b     ‾       ), and light-flavour or gluon (     t       t     ‾     LL     ) jets.

The presented survey is by no means exhaustive, but introduce some notable results and relevant techniques in the detection and inspection of marine structure electromagnetic monitoring fields. Particularly, this paper presents a review of the main research works focusing on electromagnetic detection techniques and intelligent marine vehicles for subsea cables. The marine electromagnetic exploration techniques are elaborated as active and passive detections based on different electromagnetic field generation and sensing principles. The pulse induction-based detection method for subsea ferromagnetic lines detection, transient and controlled-source electromagnetic systems in marine geological fields under the category of active detection approach, are reviewed. According to the classical applications on subsea cable-like target inspection, the passive detection approach is detailed classified as crisscrossing detection and along-tracking detection, which are characterised by different trajectories of detection vehicles. Finally, the paper discusses the marine electromagnetic detection techniques in general and highlights challenges that need to be addressed in developing detection vehicles with lower electromagnetic noises and advanced autonomy on carrying out detection missions.',\n",

We examined whether monocyte signaling pathways are differentially activated by IgG from patients with vascular thrombosis (VT) alone compared with IgG from patients with pregnancy morbidity (PM) alone. We purified IgG from 49 subjects. A human monocyte cell line and ex vivo healthy monocytes were treated with 100 microg/ml IgG for 6 h, and cell extracts were examined by immunoblot using Abs to p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. To further investigate intracellular signaling pathways induced by these IgGs, specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, TLR4, and TLR2 were used to determine their effect on TF activity. Only IgG from patients with VT but no PM (VT+/PM-) caused phosphorylation of NF-kappaBand p38 MAPK and upregulation of TF activity in monocytes. These effects were not seen with IgG from patients with PM alone (VT-/PM+), anti-phospholipid Ab-positive patients without APS, or healthy controls. TF upregulation caused by the VT+/PM- samples was reduced by inhibitors of p38 MAPK, NF-kappaB, and TLR4. The effects of VT+/PM- IgG on signaling and TF upregulation were concentrated in the fraction that bound beta-2-glycoprotein I. Our findings demonstrate that IgGs from patients with diverse clinical manifestations of APS have differential effects upon phosphorylation of NF-kappaB and p38 MAPK and TF activity that may be mediated by differential activation of TLR4.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Summary     Plasticity of cell mechanics underlies a wide range of cell and tissue behaviors allowing cells to migrate through narrow spaces, resist shear forces, and safeguard against mechanical damage. Such plasticity depends on spatiotemporal regulation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton, but mechanisms of adaptive change in cell mechanics remain elusive. Here, we report a mechanism of mechanically activated actin polymerization at focal adhesions (FAs), specifically requiring the actin elongation factor mDia1. By combining live-cell imaging with mathematical modeling, we show that actin polymerization at FAs exhibits pulsatile dynamics where spikes of mDia1 activity are triggered by contractile forces. The suppression of mDia1-mediated actin polymerization increases tension on stress fibers (SFs) leading to an increased frequency of spontaneous SF damage and decreased efficiency of zyxin-mediated SF repair. We conclude that tension-controlled actin polymerization acts as a safety valve dampening excessive tension on the actin cytoskeleton and safeguarding SFs against mechanical damage.',\n",

Materials and Methods: Of 114 patients that underwent RNU, 72 patients without preoperative ureteroscopy and a history of bladder tumor were selectively enrolled. Variables associated with IVR were identified. Results: RGP was performed at a mean duration of 24.9 days prior to RNU in 41 (56.1%) of study subjects. During the mean follow-up period of 64.5 months, IVRs were identified in 32 (44.4%) patients at 22.3±18.8 (mean±SD) months after RNU. Despite similar tumor characteristics in the RGP and non-RGP groups, the incidence of IVR was considerably higher in the RGP group (63.4%) than in the non-RGP group (19.4%, p     pT2; 53.1% vs. 17.5%), preoperative hemoglobin (12.8±1.36 vs. 13.9±1.65), preoperative creatinine (1.29±0.32 vs. 1.11±0.22), and preoperative RGP (81.3% vs. 37.5%), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression model showed that tumor location (p=0.020, HR=2.742), preoperative creatinine level (p=0.004, HR=6.351), and preoperative RGP (p=0.045, HR=3.134) independently predicted IVR. Conclusion: Given the limitations of retrospective single-center series, performance of RGP before RNU was shown to have a negative effect on IVR after surgery.',\n",

The prescribed performance means that the USV tracks a given trajectory with the arbitrarily predefined speed of response and accuracy. The existing prescribed performance control (PPC) solutions and the traditional robust control approaches for USVs may have the singularity issue or cause a discontinuous control signal. Thereby, a new-type adaptive PPC strategy is put forward in this article. The adaptive technique is devoted to tackling model imperfections as usual, whereas the constraint-handling technique is adopted in a novel way. Herein, we first construct an auxiliary variable instead of using the approach angle or azimuth angle. Then, we impose constraints on the position error, not the tracking error, and the auxiliary variable, simultaneously. In this way, the predefined performance is achieved by moreover a singularity-free continuous control action. These theoretical findings are illustrated via a comparative simulation study.',\n",

The rationale underlying this test is that we first analyze the genes associated with syndromic forms of AN, then genes that were found to carry rare variants in AN patients who had undergone segregation analysis, and finally candidate genes intervening in the same molecular pathways or identified by GWAS or in mouse models. We developed an NGS gene panel and used it to screen 68 Italian AN patients (63 females, 5 males). The panel included 162 genes. Family segregation study was conducted on available relatives of probands who reported significant genetic variants. In our analysis, we found potentially deleterious variants in 2 genes (PDE11A and SLC25A13) associated with syndromic forms of anorexia and predicted deleterious variants in the following 12 genes: CD36, CACNA1C, DRD4, EPHX2, ESR1, GRIN2A, GRIN3B, LRP2, NPY4R, PTGS2, PTPN22 and SGPP2. Furthermore, by Sanger sequencing of the promoter region of NNAT, we confirmed the involvement of this gene in the pathogenesis of AN. Family segregation studies further strengthened the possible causative role of CACNA1C, DRD4, GRIN2A, PTGS2, SGPP2, SLC25A13 and NNAT genes in AN etiology. The major finding of our study is the confirmation of the involvement of the NNAT gene in the pathogenesis of AN; furthermore, this study suggests that NGS-based testing can play an important role in the diagnostic evaluation of AN, excluding syndromic forms and increasing knowledge of the genetic etiology of AN.

       "  'abstract': 'Graph-based groupwise registration methods are widely used in atlas construction. Given a group of images, a graph is built whose nodes represent the images, and whose edges represent a geodesic path between two nodes. The distribution of images on an image manifold is explored through edge traversal in a graph. The final atlas is a mean image at the population center of the distribution on the manifold. The procedure of warping all images to the mean image turns to dynamic graph shrinkage in which nodes become closer to each other. Most conventional groupwise registration frameworks construct and shrink a graph without considering the local distribution of images on the dataset manifold and the local structure variations between image pairs. Neglecting the local information fundamentally decrease the accuracy and efficiency when population atlases are built for organs with large inter-subject anatomical variabilities. To overcome the problem, this paper proposes a global-local graph shrinkage approach that can generate accurate atlas. A connected graph is constructed automatically based on global similarities across the images to explore the global distribution. A local image distribution obtained by image clustering is used to simplify the edges of the constructed graph. Subsequently, local image similarities refine the deformation estimated through global image similarity for each image warping along the graph edges. Through the image warping, the overall simplified graph shrinks gradually to yield the atlas with respecting both global and local features. The proposed method is evaluated on 61 synthetic and 20 clinical liver datasets, and the results are compared with those of six state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms non-global-local method approaches in terms of accuracy.',\n",

Tarsi (1983) inquired into an independent and identical distribution (IID)       d       such that at each leaf, the probability of having value 0 is neither 0 nor 1. Under a reasonable assumption on the shape of a tree, he showed the existence of an optimal algorithm that is depth-first. We investigate the case where       d       is an independent distribution (ID) and probability may depend on each leaf. It is known that in this general case, if the height is greater than or equal to 3, Tarsi-type result does not hold. It is also known that for a complete binary tree of height 2, Tarsi-type result certainly holds. In this paper, we ask whether Tarsi-type result holds for an AND–OR tree of height 2. Here, a child node of the root is either an OR-gate or a leaf: The number of child nodes of an internal node is arbitrary, and depends on an internal node. We give an affirmative answer. Our strategy of the proof is to reduce the problem to the case of directional algorithms. We perform induction on the number of leaves, and modify Tarsi’s method to suite height 2 trees. We discuss why our proof does not apply to height 3 trees. This research sheds fresh light on the difference of algorithmic nature between shallow trees and deep trees.',\n",

A cross-sectional study design has been employed to include female students from the College of Arts and Science and Applied Medical Science Wadi Addawasir from January to April 2018. Chi-square/Fisher Exact test has been used for determining the occurrence of categorical variables. The questionnaire was intended to determine fast food habits prevalent among students. 97% of the students consumed fast food daily, 34% of the students were classified as prehypertensive, and 16.4% of the students were classified as hypertensive. Diastolic blood pressure was more compared to systolic blood pressure. Moreover, it was reported that 87% of the students knew the health effects of fast food. 58% of the students were not involved in physical activity and 49% of the students consumed soft drinks along with fast food. 70% of the students used table salt and 57% of the students felt thirsty after fast-food consumption. 55% of the students showed a positive response to the family history of hypertension. The findings have also shown a positive relationship between daily soft drink consumption and the incidence of prehypertension and hypertension among students. Increased consumption of salt-rich fast food, physical inactivity, genetic background of hypertension, prehypertensive and hypertensive conditions observed in the present study may expose to various cardiovascular diseases among the adult population in the future.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This article presents a modified line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law and an adaptive neural network (NN) controller for underactuated marine vehicles in the presence of uncertainties and constraints. Unlike conventional LOS guidance, the proposed guidance law counteracts the drift caused by external disturbances to maintain zero cross-track error. Furthermore, an adaptive NN controller is designed using the barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) to deal with the system constraints and disturbances affecting unknown vehicle dynamics. The stability analysis of the adaptive controller guarantees the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. The proposed control strategy is verified in the simulation and experimental environment in the presence of external disturbances. Both simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed modified LOS guidance law and adaptive NN controller guarantees asymptotic convergence to the desired path and maintains zero cross-track error despite environmental disturbances.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Anxiety symptoms co-occur with cardiovascular health problems, with increasing evidence suggesting the role of autonomic dysfunction. Yet, there is limited behavior genetic research on underlying mechanisms. In this twin study, we investigated the phenotypic, genetic and environmental associations between a latent anxiety factor and three cardiovascular autonomic function factors: interbeat interval (IBI, time between heart beats), heart rate variability (HRV, overall fluctuation of heart-beat intervals) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS, efficiency in regulating blood pressure [BP]). Multivariate twin models were fit using data of female twins (N = 250) of the Twin Interdisciplinary Neuroticism Study (TWINS). A significant negative association was identified between latent anxiety and BRS factors (r = -.24, 95% CI [-.40, -.07]). Findings suggest that this relationship was mostly explained by correlated shared environmental influences, and there was no evidence for pleiotropic genetic or unique environmental effects. We also identified negative relationships between anxiety symptoms and HRV (r = -.17, 95% CI [-.34, .00]) and IBI factors (r = -.13, 95% CI [-.29, .04]), though these associations did not reach statistical significance. Findings implicate that higher anxiety scores are associated with decreased efficiency in short-term BP regulation, providing support for autonomic dysfunction with anxiety symptomatology. The baroreflex system may be a key mechanism underlying the anxiety-cardiovascular health relationship.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the first discovered and the most prevalent posttranscriptional modification, which has been widely studied during the past decades. Pseudouridine was observed in almost all kinds of RNAs and shown to have important biological functions. Currently, the time-consuming and high-cost procedures of experimental approaches limit its uses in real-life Ψ site detection. Alternatively, by taking advantage of the explosive growth of Ψ sequencing data, the computational methods may provide a more cost-effective avenue. To date, the existing mouse Ψ site predictors were all developed based on sequence-derived features, and their performance can be further improved by adding the domain knowledge derived feature. Therefore, it is highly desirable to propose a genomic feature-based computational method to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the identification of Ψ RNA modification in the mouse transcriptome. In our study, a predictive framework PSI-MOUSE was built. Besides the conventional sequence-based features, PSI-MOUSE first introduced 38 additional genomic features derived from the mouse genome, which achieved a satisfactory improvement in the prediction performance, compared with other existing models. Moreover, PSI-MOUSE also features in automatically annotating the putative Ψ sites with diverse types of posttranscriptional regulations (RNA-binding protein [RBP]-binding regions, miRNA-RNA interactions, and splicing sites), which can serve as a useful research tool for the study of Ψ RNA modification in the mouse genome. Finally, 3282 experimentally validated mouse Ψ sites were also collected in a database with customized query functions. For the convenience of academic users, a website was built to provide a user-friendly interface for the query and analysis on the database. The website is freely accessible at www.xjtlu.edu.cn/biologicalsciences/psimouse and http://psimouse.rnamd.com. We introduced the genome-derived features to mouse for the first time, and we achieved a good performance in mouse Ψ site prediction. Compared with the existing state-of-art methods, our newly developed approach PSI-MOUSE obtained a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy, marking the reliable contributions of genomic features for the prediction of RNA modifications in a species other than human.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Diagnosis of pertussis by culture and PCR is most sensitive when performed on nasopharyngeal specimens collected <2 weeks and <3 weeks, respectively, after the onset of clinical disease. Conversely, serological testing allows the diagnosis of patients (mostly adults) with less typical whooping cough symptoms, for whom clinical samples are often collected at later time points. Here, we report on a 20-year serodiagnostic survey of pertussis in Belgium from 1990 to 2009. In total, 13,163 patients were analyzed for Bordetella pertussis-specific antibodies by agglutination, complement fixation, immunofluorescence, and ELISA. The number of positive pertussis cases detected by serodiagnosis ranged between 50 and 150 annually. The mean age of positive cases increased from 9.9 years in 1990 to 33.9 years in 2009. Whereas from 1990 to 2003, children and young adolescents made up the majority of cases, from 2004 onwards, cases were detected in all age groups and the distribution became bimodal, with a first peak at the age of 10 to 20 years and a second at the age of 35 to 50 years. In contrast, patients diagnosed since 2001 by PCR and/or culture were mostly children younger than 1 year of age. Despite extensive childhood vaccination campaigns, whooping cough is still present in Belgium. Our findings confirm the potential role of adults in the continued transmission of pertussis and strongly warrant booster or cocoon vaccinations in older age groups. Pertussis, or whooping cough, is a highly infectious and vaccine-preventable disease caused by Gram-negative Bordetella pertussis, a strict pathogen of the human respiratory tract (13). In young children, pertussis presents classically as a threestage disease with a catarrhal, a paroxysmal, and a convalescence phase evolving over a period of 4 to 8 weeks. In adults, the clinical manifestations of the disease can be less characteristic and may be easily confounded with other respiratory tract infections. Most cases of serious disease and the majority of fatalities are observed in early infancy. The infection is highly contagious, and human-to-human transmission occurs mainly through respiratory droplets. The clinical signs and pathogenicity are attributed to the presence of a wide variety of virulence factors, such as adhesins (e.g., filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA]), autotransporters (pertactin), toxins (pertussis toxin [PT], adenylate cyclase, and tracheal toxin), lipopolysaccharide, pili, the capsule, and flagellae (13). Complications include secondary infections like otitis media and pneumonia, the leading cause of death. Bronchiectasis and atelectasis can also develop. The prolonged intrathoracic raised pressure can provoke petechiae, epistaxis, subconjunctival and brain hemorrhages, and spontaneous pneumothorax. Convulsions are also noted.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'What is Austrian Economics and how is it different from “regular” economics? This is a much more difficult question to answer than it might seem. One may be tempted to answer, “how long have you got?” and risk losing the audience immediately. One has to find the right entry point, the hook necessary to draw in the curious and lead them to an understanding that comes from the commitment to reexamine one’s presumptions concerning meaning and method. In this slim volume Randall Holcombe had risen to the challenge. If read carefully it provides a comprehensive and accurate introduction for the serious student wanting to know what Austrian Economics is all about. To be sure, it is an “advanced” introduction, meaning, it seems, that some prior knowledge of economics and some conceptual maturity is assumed. Neoclassical equilibrium economics is the standard against which Austrian market process economics is compared throughout. The goal is to achieve understanding by contrast. Whereas equilibrium economics builds models distinguished by the equilibria they embody, Austrian economics examines the real-time processes by which people’s actions are ordered in a disequilibrium world, a world in which, although people’s plans are never completely coordinated, economies function effectively to peacefully produce valuable goods and services. So, rather than beginning with a standard account of the origins and development of Austrian economics (which, in fact, is the subject of the last chapter) Holcombe jumps right into the key conceptual difference that characterizes Austrian Economics—it is disequilibrium economics. The first chapter, “the Market Process” thus uses the idea of the dynamic market process to explain fundamental Austrian ideas, namely, spontaneous order; the nature and role of time and knowledge in economic activity; equilibrium as market clearing; the role and importance of entrepreneurship; the nature of realworld competition not as a state of affairs, but, rather as a discovery process; and, Rev Austrian Econ DOI 10.1007/s11138-014-0291-7',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract     Microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and microbial iron reduction (MIR) are two major anaerobic metabolic pathways, and account for the majority of anaerobic organic matter degradation in modern marine sediments. Because it is thermodynamically more favorable, the zone of porewater Fe2+ accumulation usually overlies the zone of porewater H2S accumulation in modern marine sediments. The sequence of redox reactions is collectively known as the ‘redox latter’, which has been used as a yardstick in reconstructing the marine redox landscape in Earth's history. To understand the redox profile in the early Cambrian oceans, here we analyzed syndepositional and diagenetic pyrite (FeS2) in carbonate concretions hosted in the black shale of the early Cambrian Shuijingtuo Formation in the Yangtze Block, South China. Syndepositional pyrite laminae, disseminated pyrite and diagenetic pyrite aggregates in the periphery of carbonate concretions have nearly identical sulfur isotope compositions, which cannot be resolved by quantitative reduction of seawater sulfate. Instead, a homogeneous H2S source from sulfidic (H2S-enriched) seawater might be the major sulfur source, and pyrite precipitation was sustained by H2S diffusion from sulfidic seawater. In addition, the homogeneous pyrite sulfur isotopes also imply negligible MSR in sediment porewater, reflecting low sulfate concentration in sulfidic seawater. On the other hand, the enrichment of Fe2+ in carbonate concretions implies deposition in ferruginous (Fe2+-enriched) porewater, resulting from active MIR that reduced detrital iron oxides to Fe2+. Thus, the early Cambrian sulfidic ocean might be characterized by extensive MSR in seawater and MIR in sediment porewater, which differs from the modern sulfidic ocean, such as the Black Sea, showing predominantly MSR in sediment. The development of such a reverse redox profile might be attributed to the terrestrial supply of particulate iron oxides that passed through the thermodynamically unstable sulfidic water column and low seawater sulfate concentration in sulfidic seawater that prohibited MSR in sediment. Finally, our study indicates that the redox profile might be diverse in the early Cambrian oceans.\",\n",

Hole donors and acceptors are separated either by (T–A)n bridges or by N repeated barriers consisting of (T–A,T–A) double base-pairs which are connected through single G–C base-pairs. In the former case, hole transfer rates show a strong exponential decrease with the length of the bridge for short bridges, while a switching to weak distance dependence has been observed for longer bridges. In the latter case, a power law seems to better describe the distance dependence of charge transfer rates. All these experimental observations are qualitatively reproduced by our simulations without any adjustable parameter, considering only tunneling as the charge transfer mechanism. Physical insights into the mechanism providing the switching behavior in the case of (T–A)n bridges are presented through an analysis of the eigenfunctions of the system.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The publication of a magisterial and innovative one-volume textbook on the history of music, Christopher H. Gibbs’s inspired adaptation, revision, and condensation of Richard Taruskin’s imposing, brilliant, and provocative six-volume Oxford History of Western Music (the subject of these notes in MQ 87, no. 3, 2004) invites a reconsideration of what their subject, and for that matter, ours—music—itself actually is. Additional volumes of annotated anthologies of scores and recordings back up the new textbook. Although musical examples appear in the printed text, music is represented largely, and properly so, by recordings to which students are advised to listen. Even though Gibbs has taken care to supplement the text with scores—a generous selection indeed—it is safe to assume that recording and recorded sound, in the form of CDs, MP3 files, and internet sites such as YouTube, Spotify, and Pandora, are increasingly at the core of what students assume the subject is. Recording now functions in a manner that exceeds the role of the printed color reproduction, the digital image on the computer, and the slide in art history. The key difference is that in art history, the student knows that the picture in the book (or the slide in the classroom) is just a reproduction of a “real” singular object (or of one of a limited number of objects, as in graphics and photography). The work of art—the “real” object of study—has retained its highly vaunted “aura” as a unique and inert object, one that exists outside, in the world, at a specific location, often a museum. Whether singularly or in multiple versions (e.g., Arnold Boecklin’s Isle of the Dead), tangible works of art exist; the reproduction can only imply or suggest the original and, by implication, the authentic hand of the artist. The art history textbook might be considered a primer and teaser, a preparation for facing the work itself. The most evident contrast when one finally sees the real thing is scale.

To fully harness the functionality of MXenes for applications in optics, electronics, and sensing, it is important to understand the interaction of light with MXenes on atomic and femtosecond dimensions. Here, we use ultrafast electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy to investigate the laser-induced structural dynamics of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. We find an exceptionally fast lattice response with an electron-phonon coupling time of 230 fs. Repetitive femtosecond laser excitation transforms Ti3C2Tx through a structural transition into a metamaterial with deeply sub-wavelength nanoripples that are aligned with the laser polarization. By a further laser illumination, the material is reversibly photo-switchable between a flat and rippled morphology. The resulting nanostructured MXene metamaterial with directional nanoripples is expected to exhibit an anisotropic optical and electronic response as well as an enhanced chemical activity that can be switched on and off by light.',\n",

Associations between egg and cholesterol consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in non-Western populations are still poorly documented.       Objective   Our aim was to assess egg and dietary cholesterol intake in relation to the prevalence of MetS among participants in a Chinese nationwide study.       Design   This cross-sectional study used data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991-2009).       Participants/setting   The sample consisted of 8,241 healthy Chinese adults (20 years and older).       Main outcome measures   MetS cases were defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria.       Statistical analysis   Cumulative means of egg and cholesterol consumption were calculated in accordance with 3 consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls in each examination cycle. Logistic regression models were conducted to assess the associations with prevalent MetS.       Results   Overall, 2,580 (31.3%) participants were identified as MetS cases in 2009. After multivariate adjustment, total egg consumption (>1 egg/d) was associated with 20% higher odds of MetS (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; P trend\\xa0= .001) compared with consumption of ≤1/2 egg/d. Examining cooking methods, a positive association was observed between fried egg consumption and MetS odds (OR comparing the highest category [>1/2 egg/d] with the lowest category [≤1/7 egg/d] 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.39; P trend\\xa0= .001), and nonfried egg intake was not associated with MetS odds (P trend\\xa0= .08). Total dietary intake and egg-sourced cholesterol intake were both positively correlated with MetS odds (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.53; P trend\\xa0= .005) comparing the highest consumption (>371 mg · 2,000 kcal–1 · d–1) with the lowest consumption (≤132 mg · 2,000 kcal–1 · d–1) for total dietary cholesterol (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.17 to 1.58; P trend   232 mg · 2,000 kcal–1 · d–1) with the lowest consumption (≤46 mg · 2,000 kcal–1 · d–1) for egg-sourced cholesterol; similar associations were not observed for non–egg-sourced cholesterol consumption (P trend\\xa0= .83). Substituting eggs and fried eggs for other protein sources, including low-fat and whole-fat dairy products; nuts and legumes; total red meat; processed meat; poultry meat; or seafood, was still associated with higher odds of MetS.       Conclusions   Consumption of >1 egg/d and >1/2 fried egg/d was associated with a higher prevalence of MetS than consumption of ≤1/2 egg/d and ≤1/7 fried egg/d. Future longitudinal cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to further investigate the relationship between egg consumption and MetS and explore possible mechanisms of action.',\n",

T. gondii must colonize and proliferate inside the host cells in order to maintain its own survival by securing essential nutrients for the development of the newly generated tachyzoites. The type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FASII) in the apicoplast is essential for the growth and survival of T. gondii. We investigated whether deletion of genes in the FASII pathway influences the in vitro growth and in vivo virulence of T. gondii. We focused on beta-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (FabZ) and oxidoreductase, short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins ODSCI and ODSCII. We constructed T. gondii strains deficient in FabZ, ODSCI, and ODSCII using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. The results of immunofluorescence assay, plaque assay, proliferation assay and egress assay showed that in RHΔFabZ strain the apicoplast was partly lost and the growth ability of the parasite in vitro was significantly inhibited, while for RHΔODSCI and RHΔODSCII mutant strains no similar changes were detected. RHΔFabZ exhibited reduced virulence for mice compared with RHΔODSCI and RHΔODSCII, as shown by the improved survival rate. Deletion of FabZ in the PRU strain significantly decreased the brain cyst burden in mice compared with PRUΔODSCI and PRUΔODSCII. Collectively, these findings suggest that FabZ contributes to the growth and virulence of T. gondii, while ODSCI and ODSCII do not contribute to these traits.',\n",

Therefore, it is necessary to explore new treatment methods for advanced renal cancer to obtain continuous efficacy and prolong the survival time of patients. The patient was diagnosed with advanced renal cancer that had progressed after previous antiangiogenic drug therapy, based on the clinical course and imaging findings. The patient was treated with 'tislelizumab plus apatinib'. The clinical discomfort symptoms were quickly relieved after treatment, and the evaluation two cycles later showed stable disease. After two cycles of continuation of the original regimen, reevaluation CT demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the abdominal cavity mass and the therapeutic evaluation was partial remission after four cycles; however, the patient developed abnormal liver function after treatment, manifested as nausea and poor appetite, and significantly increased bilirubin and transaminase levels, which were considered as immune-related liver injuries. After glucocorticoid treatment, the patient's condition quickly improved and recovered. This report is the first to suggest a potential approach to advanced renal clear cell carcinoma and describes the effects of immunocombination therapy on advanced renal clear cell carcinoma; the results showed the current stage success of the immunocombination treatment, suggesting that this treatment may be an effective treatment option for patients with advanced renal clear cell carcinoma. In addition, the toxic and side effects of combined immunotherapy need to be carefully identified by every doctor. Since only one patient with advanced renal cancer was observed in this report, the clinical data are very limited and further observation and accumulation of more experience are needed, and further clinical studies will be conducted on the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen.\",\n",

The formed electrospun nanofibrous mats containing Fe/Ni bimetallic NPs were characterized via different techniques. The decoloration efficiency of the two kinds of Fe/Ni NP-containing nanofibrous mats was compared with that of single metal zero-valent iron NP-containing nanofibrous mats. We show that the co-reduced Fe/Ni NP-containing nanofibrous mats have much higher decoloration efficiency than the single iron NP-immobilized polymer mats; whereas the mats containing post-coated Fe/Ni NPs have lower decoloration efficiency than the single iron NP-containing mats. The formed co-reduced Fe/Ni NP-containing polymer nanofibers can be reused for at least 4 times with high decoloration efficiency.

However, little research has systematically explored factors influencing the implementation of participatory health interventions targeting health disparities.   Objective   This study examined the utility of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) in identifying and comparing barriers and facilitators influencing implementation of participatory research trials by employing an adaptation of the CFIR to assess the implementation of a multi-component, urban public school-based participatory health intervention.   Methods   We collected qualitative data over a one-year period through weekly team meeting observational field notes and regular semi-structured interviews with five community-based participatory researchers, one school-based partner, and four school principals involved in implementing a participatory intervention in five schools. Adapted CFIR constructs guided our largely deductive approach to thematic data analysis. We ranked each of the three intervention components as high or low implementation to create an overall implementation effectiveness score for all five schools. Cross-case comparison of constructs across high and low implementation schools identified constructs that most strongly influenced implementation.   Results   Ten of 30 assessed constructs consistently distinguished between high and low implementation schools in this participatory intervention, with five strongly distinguishing. Three additional constructs played influential, though non-distinguishing, roles within this participatory intervention implementation. Influential constructs spanned all five domains and fit within three broad themes: 1) leadership engagement, 2) alignment between the intervention and institutional goals, priorities, demographics, and existing systems, and 3) tensions between adaptability and complexity within participatory interventions. However, the dynamic and collaborative nature of participatory intervention implementation underscores the artificial distinction between inner and outer settings in participatory research and the individual behavior change focus does not consider how relationships between stakeholders at multiple levels of participatory interventions shape the implementation process.   Conclusions   The CFIR is a useful framework for the assessment of participatory research trial implementation. Our findings underscore how the framework can be readily adapted to further strengthen its fit as a tool to examine project implementation in this context.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the cardio protective effects of the methanolic extract of the plant on isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction (MI). Methods:Male Wistar rats were assigned to 6 groups of control, sham, isoproterenol, and treatment with 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/12h of the extract given orally concurrent with MI induction. A subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 consecutive days was used to induce MI. The heart hemodynamic properties and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were assayed by powerlab system and spectrophotometry respectively. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA method. The myocardial histopathology properties were also studied. Results: A subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol to rats (MI group; n=6; 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 consecutive days caused ST-segment elevation in ECG, left ventricular dysfunction, intensive myocardial fibrosis along with a profound increase in myocardial MPO activity and an increase in the serum levels of TNFα. All doses of the extract significantly amended the ECG pattern and improved the left ventricular systolic pressure, contractility and relaxation (P<0.001). Interstitial fibrosis significantly was attenuated in treated groups compared with control MI group. Treatment with the extract also reduced serum levels of TNFα (at least 40.35%) and myocardial MPO activity (at least 30.47%).

This study aims to explore the underlying regulatory mechanisms of CAP activity in the progression of AS. (2) Methods: The Apoe-/- mice were subjected to sham, bilateral cervical vagotomy surgery (VGX), and VGX supplemented with Gainesville Tokushima scientists (GTS)-21 (4 mg/kg/d) and then fed with a high-fat diet for 10 weeks. Atherosclerotic lesion size and inflammation levels were investigated by histology and inflammatory cytokines analysis. The blood M1/M2 macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry. Primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were treated with CAP agonists acetylcholine (Ach) and GTS-21 to study their effects on macrophage functions. (3) Results: Compared with the sham group, inhibition of CAP by the VGX resulted in growing aortic lipid plaque area, deteriorated inflammatory levels, and aberrant quantity of M1/M2 macrophages in Apoe-/- mice. However, these detrimental effects of VGX were significantly ameliorated by the reactivation of CAP through GTS-21 treatment. The in vitro study using macrophages revealed that stimulation with CAP agonists suppressed M1, but promoted M2 macrophage polarization through the upregulation of TNFAIP3 and phosphorylation STAT3 levels, respectively. Moreover, the activation of CAP inhibited the formation of macrophage foam cells in the peritoneal cavity by regulating genes related to cholesterol metabolism. (4) Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence and mechanisms that the CAP plays an important role in the regulation of AS development by controlling macrophage functions, implying a potential use of CAP activation as a therapeutic strategy for AS treatment.',\n",

Plasma concentration of IGF-1, of total pro - tein, albumin, glucose, urea, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and of the acute phase protein haptoglobin was measured in all dogs. The CIBDAI scores decreased during the treatment period in FRD and IBD ( P < 0.05).

IGF-1/BW ratios were lower in FRD and IBD before treatment than in C ( P < 0.01). IGF-1/BW ratios increased in FRD ( P < 0.05) dogs during treatment. Plasma glucose concentration was lower in FRD dogs before treatment than in C ( P < 0.05), and NEFA concentrations were higher in FRD dogs before and after treatment than in C ( P < 0.001).

The patient often experienced paresthesia in both arms, but did not complain of proximal arm or leg weakness. He had been drinking about 200 mL of alcohol every day for 30 years. A physical examination revealed excessive soft tissues around his neck, shoulder, and forearm (Fig. 1A). His hand grip, finger abduction, wrist flexion/extension, and elbow extension were extremely weak (Medical Research Council scale grades from 1 to 3) on both sides with muscle atrophy in the first dorsal interossei, hypothenar, and pectoralis major muscles. Deep tendon reflexes were absent in both arms. A nerve conduction study revealed no potentials in the ulnar and radial motor nerves or the medial and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves of the left arm. Electromyography revealed positive sharp waves and fibrillation potentials in the first dorsal interosseous, abductor pollicis longus, and extensor carpi radialis of the left arm. Long-duration, high-amplitude motor unit action potentials (MUPs) were present in all muscles of the left arm with reduced recruitment of MUPs. Magnetic resonance images showed extensive fat proliferation and infiltration at the face, neck, shoulder, and axilla that resulted in compression of the brachial plexus (Fig. 1B). He was diagnosed with bilateral brachial plexopathy secondary to MSL, and was operated on to relieve the compression of the brachial plexus. After the surgery, the weaknesses in his hands were slightly improved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFig. 1\\r\\n\\r\\nA: Excessive fatty tissues around the neck and shoulder. B: Coronal fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI reveals the brachial plexus (thick arrow) compressed by lipoma (thin arrow).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incidence of MSL is highest in Mediterranean countries, and it is uncommon in Asia (including Korea). A case-series study of Korean MSL patients found that most patients visited hospital because of a mass lesion and some of them were complicated with peripheral neuropathy.4 The etiology of the disease is not fully understood, but most patients included in previous studies have had a history of chronic excessive alcohol consumption.5 While the exact role of alcohol in the pathophysiology remains elusive, defects in adrenergic stimulated lipolysis or hypertrophy of the brown fat cells have been proposed as an alternative explanation for the pathomechanism.6 The differential diagnosis should include other forms of generalized lipomatosis such as Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Proteus syndrome, and Dercum disease.7 Familial multiple lipomatosis manifests as multiple encapsulated lipomas with autosomal dominant inheritance, but with relative sparing of the head and shoulders.8 Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Liposuction can be applied alone9 or in combination with lipectomy.10\",\n",

The present study investigated the role of circ_POLA2 in endometrial cancer (EC). The mRNA expression levels of circ_POLA2 and microRNA (miR)-31 in EC and paired adjacent normal tissues were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-qPCR). Overexpression of circ_POLA2 was achieved in the EC cell lines, and its effects on miR-31 mRNA expression level and methylation were evaluated using RT-qPCR and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. Cell proliferation was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. The results indicated that circ_POLA2 was highly expressed in EC tissue and inversely correlated with miR-31 mRNA expression level. MSP analysis showed that circ_POLA2 overexpression increased miR-31 methylation and RT-qPCR analysis showed that circ_POLA2 overexpression decreased miR-31 mRNA expression level. Furthermore, circ_POLA2 overexpression also increased EC cell proliferation, while miR-31 overexpression decreased cell proliferation. Finally, circ_POLA2 overexpression reduced the effects of miR-31 overexpression. In conclusion, circ_POLA2 may increase miR-31 methylation of miR-31 in EC cells to promote cancer cell proliferation.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The question of why some firms grow faster than others is of high theoretical and practical importance. Beyond a wealth of studies based on stochastic models, firm growth has mostly been explained by looking at the structural characteristics of firms, sectors, and countries. The role of managers’ characteristics in fostering firms’ growth has been explored much less. In this study, we adopt one key characteristic of managers, the age of the chief executive officer (CEO) and examine its relationship with the firm’s organic growth. Using data from a large sample of European manufacturing firms, we find that firms managed by young CEOs grow faster in terms of sales and assets, but not in terms of profitability. These results hold with the inclusion of a large vector of firm and CEO characteristics, and a battery of robustness checks, including issues related to the time horizon and appointment of CEOs, the educational attainment of younger cohorts of managers, and endogeneity. We hypothesize that young CEOs are incentivized to boost firm growth to signal their talent in the managerial market and to secure a longer stream of future compensation benefits. To the extent that firm growth does not translate into higher profitability, this may create an agency problem, due to the divergence of this corporate strategy from shareholders’ targets. In line with this hypothesis, we find that a more concentrated ownership that allows for more effective monitoring moderates the relationship between CEO age and firm growth. Firms managed by CEOs younger than 45 grow faster, especially when ownership is not concentrated and does not coincide with management. In\\xa0a large sample of European manufacturing firms in the period 2009–2014 we find that firms managed by younger CEOs grow faster in terms of sales and assets, but not in terms of profitability. These results suggest that younger CEOs maximize their utility by growing the size of their firms, to signal their talent in the market for managers, and to achieve a higher compensation linked to firm size, instead of the shareholders’ target of profit maximization. An effective way to re-align the divergent interests of managers and shareholders is monitoring via more concentrated ownership. Indeed, we find that the relationship between CEO age and firm growth is weaker when ownership is more concentrated. These results bear implications for policy and governance. As for policy, given the well-known “gerontocracy” that affects management (and board members) in many European countries, faster turnover in CEOs could foster aggregate growth via higher business dynamism and a more efficient reallocation of market shares. As for governance, we show that the independence of managers from shareholders enhances firm growth.',\n",

In the present study, a spatial-temporal analysis was carried out at ten sampling sites of Prayagraj and Varanasi during June 2017 and March 2018 to determine the Ganga River water quality using physico-chemical parameters, cyanobacteria diversity, detection of MCs producing strains and MC-LR equivalence. Coliform bacteria, COD, NO3-N, and phosphate are the significant contaminated parameters favoring the growth of putative MCs producing cyanobacteria. National Sanitation Foundation WQI (NSFWQI) indicates water quality, either bad or medium category at sampling points. The morphological analysis confirms the occurrence of diverse cyanobacterial genera such as Microcystis, Anabaena, Oscillatoria, and Phormidium. PCR amplification affirmed the presence of toxic microcystin (mcy) genes in uncultured cyanobacteria at all the sampling sites. The concentration of MC-LR equivalence in water samples by protein phosphatase 1 inhibition assay (PPIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods was observed in the range of 23.4–172 ng/L and 13.2–97.5 ng/L respectively which is lower than the harmful exposure limit by World Health Organization (WHO). Ganga isolate 1 was identified as Microcystis based on partial 16S rDNA sequence and its toxicity was confirmed due to presence of mcy genes and MCs production potential. These findings suggest the presence of MCs producers as new emerging parameter to monitor water quality index and identification up to species level will be valuable for restoration strategies of river Ganga.',\n",

This feature is particularly harmful for nosocomial pathogens that can survive on hospital surfaces. Research studies have been conducted to evaluate new materials that are able to counteract the microbial growth and the colonization of the hospital environment. In this context, nanotechnologies have showed encouraging applications. We investigated the antibacterial activity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), both pristine (p) and functionalized (f), at concentrations of 50 and 100 μg mL−1, against bacterial strains isolated from hospital-acquired infections, and this activity was correlated with the antibiotic susceptibility of the strains. The inhibiting effect of MWCNTs occurred for both types and doses tested. Moreover, f-MWCNTs exerted a greater inhibiting effect, with growth decreases greater than 10% at 24 h and 20% at 48 h compared to p-MWCNTs. Moreover, a lower inhibitory effect of MWCNTs, which was more lasting in Gram-positives resistant to cell wall antibiotics, or temporary in Gram-negatives resistant to nucleic acid and protein synthesis inhibitors, was observed, highlighting the strong relation between antibiotic resistance and MWCNT effect. In conclusion, an antimicrobial activity was observed especially for f-MWCNTs that could therefore be loaded with bioactive antimicrobial molecules. However, this potential application of CNTs presupposes the absence of toxicity and therefore total safety for patients.',\n",

C57BL/6 mice do not express Pla2g2a due to a frameshift mutation (wild-type [WT] mice). We previously reported that transgenic expression of human PLA2G2A in C57BL/6 mice (IIA+ mice) protects against weight gain and insulin resistance, in part by increasing total energy expenditure. Additionally, we found that brown and white adipocytes from IIA+ mice have increased expression of mitochondrial uncoupling markers, such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator, and PR domain containing 16, suggesting that the energy expenditure phenotype might be due to an increased thermogenic capacity in adipose tissue. Here, we further characterize the impact of PLA2G2A on thermogenic mechanisms in adipose tissue. Metabolic analysis of WT and IIA+ mice revealed that even when housed within their thermoneutral zone, IIA+ mice have elevated energy expenditure compared to WT littermates. Increased energy expenditure in IIA+ mice is associated with increased citrate synthase activity in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and increased mitochondrial respiration in both brown and white adipocytes. We also observed that direct addition of recombinant PLA2G2A enzyme to in vitro cultured adipocytes results in the marked induction of UCP1 protein expression. Finally, we report that PLA2G2A induces the expression of numerous transcripts related to energy substrate transport and metabolism in BAT, suggestive of an increase in substrate flux to fuel BAT activity. These data demonstrate that PLA2G2A enhances adipose tissue thermogenesis, in part, through elevated substrate delivery and increased mitochondrial content in BAT.',\n",

The general procedure of FC-ANN is as follows: firstly fuzzy clustering technique is used to generate different training subsets. Subsequently, based on different training subsets, different ANN models are trained to formulate different base models. Finally, a meta-learner, fuzzy aggregation module, is employed to aggregate these results.

       "  'abstract': 'The neocortex of the human brain is the seat of higher brain function. Modern imaging techniques, chief among them magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow non-invasive imaging of this important structure. Knowledge of the microstructure of the neocortex has classically come from post-mortem histological studies of human tissue, and extrapolations from invasive animal studies. From these studies, we know that the scale of important neocortical structure spans six orders of magnitude, ranging from the size of axonal diameters (microns), to the size of cortical areas responsible for integrating sensory information (centimetres). MRI presents an opportunity to move beyond classical methods, because MRI is non-invasive and MRI contrast is sensitive to neocortical microstructure over all these length scales. MRI thus allows inferences to be made about neocortical microstructure in vivo, i.e. MRI-based in vivo histology. We review recent literature that has applied and developed MRI-based in vivo histology to probe the microstructure of the human neocortex, focusing specifically on myelin, iron, and neuronal fibre mapping. We find that applications such as cortical parcellation (using [Formula: see text] maps as proxies for myelin content) and investigation of cortical iron deposition with age (using [Formula: see text] maps) are already contributing to the frontiers of knowledge in neuroscience. Neuronal fibre mapping in the cortex remains challenging in vivo, but recent improvements in diffusion MRI hold promise for exciting applications in the near future. The literature also suggests that utilising multiple complementary quantitative MRI maps could increase the specificity of inferences about neocortical microstructure relative to contemporary techniques, but that further investment in modelling is required to appropriately combine the maps. In vivo histology of human neocortical microstructure is undergoing rapid development. Future developments will improve its specificity, sensitivity, and clinical applicability, granting an ever greater ability to investigate neuroscientific and clinical questions about the human neocortex.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Purpose – This article aims to bring readers up to date with policy developments in England and Northern Ireland in the last two years since the journal first reported on these issues. Design/methodology/approach – As well as looking at changes to policy and legislation, the paper highlights not only the differences but also the shared concerns for people with intellectual disability living in the two countries, e.g. equal access to healthcare as experienced by the general population. Findings – In spite of shared visions of inclusion and equality in mental health care, there are major differences in how both countries approach these issues. Recently this has been highlighted by significant shifts in policy. In Northern Ireland strategies designed to inform the delivery of evidence based services for the future have been witnessed. Whilst in England there has also been a move towards public protection within mental health legislation and the reaffirmation of the need to move towards more individual services. Whilst policy initiatives in both countries have been encouraging; they need to be implemented so issues such as access to healthcare and geographical disparity are addressed by local providers. Social implications – Although there is a desire for change, the reality is that the policies and legislation introduced to address issues such as accessing mental health care and service standards have still to make a significant impact to people's daily lives. Originality/value – This paper offers an update of current practice and policy relating to mental health for people with intellectual disabilities in England and Northern Ireland.\",\n",

The bimodal silica-gel samples were synthesized by pseudomorphic transformation of a mesoporous silica gel. A set of eight samples was generated using different volumes of 0.07\\xa0M cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (5–42\\xa0ml/g) to obtain bimodal pore systems with controlled proportions of 15\\xa0nm pores of the original silica-gel and 4\\xa0nm pores formed by the MCM-41 phase. The aim was to proof if it is possible to determine the pore volumes directly from the PALS experiment. The results of the PALS measurements clearly indicate the bimodal pore structure in the materials. Two individual pore systems can be detected with a good resolution. The peak area of the signals can be calculated and compared with the pore volumes determined by nitrogen adsorption. The results show a correlation between the pore volume determined by nitrogen adsorption and the peak area calculated from PALS. Some differences between the measured pore volumes of the starting material can be an indication for the formation of a closed porosity in the starting material and after the processes of pseudomorphic transformation. The PALS measurements enable a complementary characterisation of pore systems in the micro- and mesopore range. Bimodal structured porous materials can be studied and the individual pore systems are well separated. The observed correlation between intensities (respectively peak areas) from PALS and pore volumes determined by nitrogen adsorption for the different pore classes allows the direct estimation of the pore volumes by PALS via calibration and the quantification of a potential closed porosity.',\n",

As such, it is becoming increasingly important to rapidly identify bursts of interest as soon as possible after the event, before the afterglows fade beyond detectability.Studyingthemostdistant(highestredshift)events,forinstance,remainsaprimarygoalformanyinthe field. Here, we present our Random Forest Automated Triage Estimator for GRB redshifts (RATE GRB-z) for rapid identification of high-redshift candidates using early-time metrics from the three telescopes onboard Swift. While the basic RATE methodology is generalizable to a number of resource allocation problems, here we demonstrate its utility for telescope-constrained follow-up efforts with the primary goal to identify and study high-z GRBs. For each new GRB, RATE GRB-z provides a recommendation—based on the available telescope time—of whether the event warrants additional follow-up resources. We train RATE GRB-z using a set consisting of 135 Swift bursts with known redshifts, only 18 of which are z> 4. Cross-validated performance metrics on these training data suggest that ∼56% of high-z bursts can be captured from following up the top 20% of the ranked candidates, and ∼84% of high-z bursts are identified after following up the top ∼40% of candidates. We further use the method to rank 200+ Swift bursts with unknown redshifts according to their likelihood of being high-z.',\n",

Social network analysis is underutilized in exploring such associations. The paper aims to describe physicians’ and nurses’ relationships outside their clinical units and to explore what kind of ties are related to job performance. A network analysis was performed on cross-sectional data. The study population consisted of 196 healthcare employees working in a public hospital and a primary healthcare centre in Spain. Relational data were analysed using the UCINET software package. Measures included: (i) sample characteristics; (ii) social network variables; and (iii) team performance ratings. Descriptive statistics (means, medians, percentages) were used to characterize staff and performance ratings. A correlational analysis was conducted to examine the strength of relationships between four different types of ties. Our findings suggest that external ties only contribute to improving the performance of physicians at both the individual and team level. They are focused on the decision-making process about the therapeutic plan and, therefore, might need to seek advice outside the workplace. In contrast, external ties are not relevant for the work performance of nurses, as they need to find solutions to immediate problems in a short period of time, having strong ties in the workplace. Social network analysis can illuminate relations within healthcare organizations and inform the development of innovative interventions.',\n",

We have previously shown that the phyto-molecule icariin significantly promoted osteogenic differentiation of rat adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between icariin induced osteogenic differentiation of ASCs and angiogenesis of rat endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Besides, we used icariin doped 45S5 Bioglass seeded with ASCs to promote bone healing in rat calvarial bone defect models.       Main methods   The conditioned medium from undifferentiated ASCs (ASCs-CM) and icariin induced ASCs (Icariin-ASCs-CM) was obtained and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein secretion level was measured. The angiogenic capacity and molecular mechanism of ASC-CM and Icariin-ASCs-CM on rat EPCs was analyzed. Rat calvarial bone defect models were established and treated with scaffolds implantation. Micro-CT imaging, histological and immunohistological staining were performed on the isolated specimens at 12\\u202fweeks post-surgery.       Key findings   VEGF protein expression was significantly increased after icariin treatment with the highest expression in the 10−7\\u202fM icariin group. Icariin-ASCs-CM obviously increased the angiogenesis of rat EPCs and this capacity was inhibited by a VEGF/VEGF receptor-specific binding inhibitor bevacizumab. Results of the in vivo investigations showed that all scaffolds promoted bone healing compared to the Control group. Icariin significantly improved the healing capacity of 45S5 Bioglass seeded with ASCs.       Significance   Implantation of Icariin/45S5 Bioglass seeded with rat ASCs could obviously promote both osteogenesis and angiogenesis and therefore represents an ideal candidate bone substitutes for bone repair and regeneration.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'A key feature of normal neonatal EEG at term age is interhemispheric synchrony (IHS), which refers to the temporal co-incidence of bursting across hemispheres during trace alternant EEG activity. The assessment of IHS in both clinical and scientific work relies on visual, qualitative EEG assessment without clearly quantifiable definitions. A quantitative measure, activation synchrony index (ASI), was recently shown to perform well as compared to visual assessments. The present study set out to test whether IHS is stable enough for clinical use, and whether it could be an objective feature of EEG normality. We analyzed 31 neonatal EEG recordings that had been clinically classified as normal (n=14) or abnormal (n=17) using holistic, conventional visual criteria including amplitude, focal differences, qualitative synchrony, and focal abnormalities. We selected 20-minute epochs of discontinuous background pattern. ASI values were computed separately for different channel pair combinations and window lengths to define the optimal ASI intraindividual stability. Finally, ROC curves were computed to find trade-offs related to compromised data lengths, a common challenge in neonatal EEG studies. Using the average of four consecutive 2.5-minute epochs in the centro-occipital bipolar derivations gave ASI estimates that very accurately distinguished babies clinically classified as normal vs. abnormal. It was even possible to draw a cut-off limit (ASI~3.6) which correctly classified the EEGs in 97% of all cases. Finally, we showed that compromising the length of EEG segments from 20 minutes to 5 minutes leads to increased variability in ASI-based classification. Our findings support the prior literature that IHS is an important feature of normal neonatal brain function. We show that ASI may provide diagnostic value even at individual level, which strongly supports its use in prospective clinical studies on neonatal EEG as well as in the feature set of upcoming EEG classifiers.',\n",

The aim of this study was to modify the IMB model to explore the effects of self-management on glycemic control in T2DM patients in Shanghai, China. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on participants recruited using a convenience sampling method between June and August 2015 in three tertiary hospitals and four community health service centers; 796 participants meeting the inclusion criteria (age ≥18 years and a diagnosis of T2DM) completed a questionnaire and blood test for glycemic control. Structural equation models were used to test the IMB framework. RESULTS The modified model demonstrated an acceptable fit of the data. Paths from information to self-management behaviors (β = 0.119, P = 0.001) and HbA1c (β = -0.140, P < 0.001), from motivation to behavioral skills (β = 0.670, P < 0.001), from behavioral skills to self-management behaviors (β = 0.562, P < 0.001), and from self-management behaviors to HbA1c (β = -0.343, P < 0.001) were all significant and in the predicted direction. Information and motivation varied with each other (r = 0.350, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Glycemic control can be incorporated into the IMB model. The utility of the modified model in the study population is validated.

The results show similar power system costs for different target levels. RES-E shares below 70% involve limited infrastructure costs that are below 2.6% of the overall system costs. The impacts of the modelled RES-E policies, an EU quota and national feed-in premiums on transmission costs are ambiguous: Contrary to expectations, the costs of transmission network development under quota obligations are lower than under technology-specific feed-in premiums for RES-E penetration levels up to 50%. The drivers of transmission costs include not only a concentration of renewable capacity, but also the exact location of RES-E capacity with respect to existing power plants and the strength of the existing infrastructure. Quota obligations lead to higher grid costs than feed-in premiums if the RES-E share amounts to 70% due to the stronger regional concentration of RES power plants.',\n",

Distribution of the two main lineages concords with Wallace's water types: one restricted to the acidic and nutrient-poor waters of the Negro River (herein Rio Negro lineage) and a second widespread throughout the remaining of the species' distribution (herein Amazonas lineage). These lineages occur over a very broad geographical range, suggesting that despite occurring in regions separated by thousands of kilometres, individuals of the distinct lineages fail to occupy each other's habitats, hundreds of metres apart and not separated by physical barrier. Reproductive isolation was assessed in isolated pairs exposed to black-water conditions. All pairs with at least one individual of the lineage not native to black waters showed significantly lower spawning success, suggesting that the water type affected the fitness and contributed to reproductive isolation. Our results endorse Wallace's intuition and highlight the importance of ecological factors in shaping diversity of the Amazon fish fauna.\",\n",

In order to document the detailed geometry of the km-scale folds exposed in cliff-forming, largely inaccessible outcrops, a new surveying technique was developed that combines data from a theodolite and laser range finder. The field observations, survey profiles, and cross section reconstructions, indicate that late-stage thrust breakthrough of the anticlines within the mechanically competent Lisburne Group carbonates accommodated continued shortening when other mechanisms became unfeasible, including fold tightening, forelimb rotation, and parasitic folding in the anticline forelimbs. These results provide constraints on the processes that govern the transition from buckle folding to thrust truncation in fold-and-thrust belts worldwide.',\n",

HCV maturation and/or the egress pathway requires host sphingolipid synthesis, which occur in the Golgi. Ceramide transfer protein (CERT) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) play a crucial role in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Protein kinase D (PKD), a serine/threonine kinase, is recruited to the trans-Golgi network where it influences vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane by regulation of several important mediators via phosphorylation. PKD attenuates the function of both CERT and OSBP by phosphorylation at their respective Ser132 and Ser240 residues (phosphorylation inhibition). Here, we investigated the functional role of PKD in HCV secretion. Our studies show that HCV gene expression down-regulated PKD activation. PKD depletion by shRNA or inhibition by pharmacological inhibitor Go6976 enhanced HCV secretion. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of PKD suppressed HCV secretion. The suppression by PKD was subverted by the ectopic expression of nonphosphorylatable serine mutant CERT S132A or OSBP S240A. These observations imply that PKD negatively regulates HCV secretion/release by attenuating OSBP and CERT functions by phosphorylation inhibition. This study identifies the key role of the Golgi components in the HCV maturation process.',\n",

The tablets were prepared using sodium HPMC K4M / HPMC K15M as bio-adhesive polymers and sodium bicarbonate acting as a floating layer. Tablets were evaluated based on different parameters such as thickness, hardness, friability, weight variation, in vitro dissolution studies, content of active ingredient and IR studies. The physico-chemical properties of the finished product complied with the specifications. In vitro release from the formulation was studied as per the USP XXIII dissolution procedure. The formulations gave a normal release effect followed by sustained release for 12 h which indicates bimodal release of ziprasidone HCl from the matrix tablets. The data obtained was fitted to Peppas models. Analysis of n values of the Korsmeyer equation indicated that the drug release involved non-diffusional mechanisms. By the present study, it can be concluded that bi-layer tablets of ziprasidone HCl and trihexyphenidyl HCl will be a useful strategy for extending the metabolism and improving the bioavailability of Ziprasidone HCl and Trihexyphenidyl HCl.',\n",

One mechanism of action is thought to be though the ability of biologics to induce homing and migration of endogenous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to a target tissue. However, the ability of biologics to stimulate chemotaxis (directed migration of cells) and chemokinesis (increase rate of cell migration) of MSCs is unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHypothesis/Purpose \\r\\nThe aim of this study was to directly compare the ability of biologics including platelet rich plasma (PRP) and bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to induce MSC migration. The hypothesis was that leukocyte-low platelet rich plasma (Llo PRP) would induce migration to a greater extent than leukocyte-high platelet rich plasma (Lhi PRP) or BMC.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods \\r\\nBone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated from 8 horses. Migration of MSCs toward a biologic (BMC, Llo PRP, and Lhi PRP) or the positive control platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) was continuously traced and measured for 24hrs using time-lapse microscopy and a microfluidics device. Cell migration, chemotaxis and chemokinesis were determined by measurements of displacement, number of cells migrated, and cell flux.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResults \\r\\nAll biologics resulted in a significantly greater percentage of MSCs migrated compared to the positive control (PDGF). MSCs migrated further toward BMC compared to Llo PRP. Cell migration, measured as cell flux, was greater toward BMC and Lhi PRP than Llo PRP.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion \\r\\nThe biologics BMC and Lhi PRP elicit greater chemotaxis and chemokinesis of MSCs than Llo PRP. However, all biologics recruited the same number of MSCs suggesting that differences in other regenerative effects, such as growth factor concentration, between biologics should be strongly considered when choosing a biologic for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. The results of this study have the potential to reduce the need, risks, and costs associated with MSC culture and delivery.',\n",

The modified bio-chars are used to capture Hg0 from simulated flue gas. The physical and chemical properties of the samples are investigated by various characterization technologies, including proximate and ultimate analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effects of different types of halides impregnation, halide loading values, individual flue gas component and adsorption temperature on removal of Hg0 over adsorbents were studied. The mechanism and kinetics of Hg0 removal were also studied. The results show that potassium iodide modified bio-chars have better Hg0 adsorption performance than bio-chars modified by potassium chloride and potassium bromide. The optimal potassium iodide loading value is 3\\u202fwt%. As the reaction temperature increases, Hg0 removal efficiency significantly increases. O2 promotes the Hg0 removal. Addition of SO2 inhibits Hg0 removal over enteromorpha-chars, and shows a double impact on Hg0 removal over sargassum-chars. Low concentrations of NO and H2O are beneficial to Hg0 removal, whereas high concentrations of NO and H2O inhibit Hg0 removal. Chemisorption is found to be the main control factor for Hg0 adsorption at 120\\u202f°C and 160\\u202f°C based on kinetic simulation analysis. The covalent groups (C-I) and the chemisorbed oxygen and/or weakly bonded oxygen species participate in the Hg0 removal process and are the dominant chemical adsorption sites on the suface of the iodide modified seaweed bio-chars.',\n",

The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects as well as total phenolic and flavonoid contents of a number of medicinal plants collected from the Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari provinces of India, in order to investigate their potential use for the production of new antibiotics. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the maceration method was used to prepare hydroalcoholic extract of Medicago sativa, Onosma sericeum, Parietaria judaica L., Phlomis persica and Echinophora platyloba DC. The effect of these plants on Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) was investigated. To determine the antibacterial effect of the extracts, broth microdilution in sterile 96-well plate was used according to the McFarland standard (105 CFU/ml). The total phenolic content was assayed by using the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric method and expressed in terms of gallic acid equivalent. The total flavonoid content was assayed by aluminum chloride colorimetric method and expressed in terms of rutin equivalent. Results: Based on the results of this study, the 512, 256, 128, 32 and 32 mu g/ml doses were determined to be the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), and the 1024, 1024, 512, 128 and 128 mu g/ml doses were derived as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBCs) of M. sativa, O.

Applicability of the specialized version of the computer program PASS for searching original inhibitors of 3′-processing reaction among commercially available samples of chemical compounds, belonging to a new chemical class, is shown. We compared the general pharmacological profiles calculated by PASS for the sets of original integrase inhibitors found in the study with those for known inhibitors published in literature.

As its effect on kidney function is discrepant and complicated, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of dapagliflozin on the progression of diabetic nephropathy and related mechanisms.     Methods:     Twelve-week-old male C 57 BL/6 wild-type and db/db mice were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg dapagliflozin for 12 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, insulin tolerance, glucose tolerance, pyruvate tolerance and 24-hour urine were measured every 4 weeks. At 24 weeks of age, renal function was evaluated by blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine clearance, urine output, urinary albumin excretion, Periodic Acid-Schiff staining, Masson’s trichrome staining and electron microscopy. Changes in insulin signaling and gluconeogenic key regulatory enzymes were detected using Western blot analysis.     Results:     Dapagliflozin did not alleviate but instead aggravated diabetic nephropathy manifesting as increased levels of microalbuminuria, blood urea nitrogen, and glomerular and tubular damage in db/db mice. Despite adequate glycemic control by dapagliflozin, urinary glucose excretion increased after administration before 24 weeks of age and was likely associated with renal impairment. Increased urinary glucose excretion was mainly derived from the disturbance of glucose homeostasis with elevated hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis induced by dapagliflozin. Although it had no effect on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, dapagliflozin further induced the expression of gluconeogenic key rate-limiting enzymes through increasing the expression levels of FoxO1 in the kidney and liver.     Conclusion:     These experimental results indicate that dapagliflozin aggravates diabetes mellitus-induced kidney injury, mostly through increasing gluconeogenesis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The present study investigated the role of dietary cholesterol and fat in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a common liver disease in metabolic disorders. Mice were fed a diet of regular chow (CH), chow supplemented with 0.2% w/w cholesterol (CHC), high fat (HF, 45kcal%) or HF with cholesterol (HFC) for 17weeks. While both HF and HFC groups displayed hepatic steatosis and metabolic syndrome, only HFC group developed the phenotype of liver injury, as indicated by an increase in plasma level of alanine transaminase (ALT, by 50-80%). There were ~2-fold increases in mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 in the liver of HFC-fed mice (vs. HF) but no endoplasmic reticulum stress or oxidative stress was observed. Furthermore, cholesterol suppressed HF-induced increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and mitochondrial transcription factor A expression and blunted fatty acid oxidation. Interestingly, after switching HFC to HF diet for 5weeks, the increases in plasma ALT and liver inflammatory markers were abolished but the blunted of mitochondrial function remained. These findings suggest that cholesterol plays a critical role in the conversion of a simple fatty liver toward nonalcoholic steatohepatitis possibly by activation of inflammatory pathways together with retarded mitochondrial function.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"PURPOSE First measurements of the imaging performance of a novel prototype water-equivalent electronic portal imaging device (EPID) designed for simultaneous imaging and dose verification in radiotherapy and previously characterized by our group for dosimetry are reported. Experiments were conducted to characterize the prototype's imaging performance relative to a standard commercial EPID and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed to quantify the impact of several detector parameters on image quality and to inform the design of a proposed next-generation prototype. METHODS The prototype EPID utilizes an array of 3 cm long plastic-scintillating fibers in place of the metal plate/phosphor screen in standard EPIDs. Using a clinical 6 MV photon beam, the prototype's modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) were measured and compared to measurements taken using a standard commercial EPID. A sensitivity analysis was then performed using the MC model by quantifying these metrics while varying the values of several geometrical and optical transport parameters that were unspecified by the prototype manufacturer. Finally, the MC model was used to quantify the imaging performance of a proposed next-generation prototype incorporating 1.5 cm long fibers that is better suited for integration with clinical portal imaging and dosimetry systems. RESULTS The prototype EPID's zero spatial frequency DQE exceeded 3%, more than doubling that measured with the standard EPID (1.25%). This increased DQE was a consequence of using a prototype array detector with a greater equivalent thickness than the combined copper plate and phosphor screen in a standard EPID. The increased thickness of our prototype decreased spatial resolution relative to the standard EPID; however, the prototype EPID NPS was also lower than that measured with the standard EPID across all spatial frequencies. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the NPS was strongly affected by the roughness of the boundaries between fiber core and cladding regions. By comparison, the MTF was most sensitive to beam divergence and the presence of air between the fiber array and underlying photodiode panel. Simulations demonstrated that by optimizing these parameters, DQE(0) >4% may be achievable with the proposed next-generation prototype design. CONCLUSIONS The first measurements characterizing the imaging performance of a novel water-equivalent EPID for imaging and dosimetry in radiotherapy demonstrated a DQE(0) more than double that of a standard EPID. MC simulations further demonstrated the potential for developing a next-generation prototype better suited for clinical translation with even higher DQE.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Endochondral ossification, an important stage of fracture healing, is regulated by a variety of signaling pathways. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily plays important roles and comprises TGFβs, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and growth differentiation factors. TGFβs primarily regulate cartilage formation and endochondral ossification. BMP2 shows diverse efficacy, from the formation of skeleton and extraskeletal organs to the osteogenesis and remodeling of bone. G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (GIT1), a shuttle protein in osteoblasts, facilitates fracture healing by promoting bone formation and increasing the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. Our study examined whether GIT1 regulates fracture healing through the BMP2 signaling pathway and/or through the TGFβ signaling pathway. GIT1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited delayed fracture healing, chondrocyte accumulation in the fracture area, and reduced staining intensity of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (pSmad1/5/8) and Runx2. Endochondral mineralization diminished while the staining intensity of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (pSmad2/3) showed no significant change. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells extracted from GIT1 KO mice showed a decline of pSmad1/5/8 levels and of pSmad1/5/8 translocated into the cell nucleus after BMP2 stimulus. We detected no significant change in the pSmad2/3 level after TGFβ1 stimulus. Data obtained from reporter gene analysis of C3H10T1/2 cells cultured in vitro confirmed these findings. GIT1-siRNA inhibited transcription in the cell nucleus via pSmad1/5/8 after BMP2 stimulus but had no significant effect on transcription via pSmad2/3 after TGFβ1 stimulus. Our results indicate that GIT1 regulates Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and mediates BMP2 regulation of Runx2 expression, thus affecting endochondral ossification at the fracture site.',\n",

The two main parameters which are initially of fundamental importance for the fracture process are the weak layer specific fracture energy and the stiffness of the overlying slab. So far, only few values of weak layer fracture energy exist, mainly because the stiffness of the slab cannot easily be determined. We have performed about 150 propagation saw tests to obtain the weak layer fracture energy from measurements of critical crack length, slab thickness and density. To estimate the stiffness of the slab needed to calculate the energy release rate, we used snow micro-penetrometer measurements. The values of the effective elastic modulus ranged from 1.8 to 12\\xa0MPa. The specific fracture energy of the weak layer was evaluated using a finite element (FE) model. For our weak layer/slab configurations we obtained specific fracture energies on the order of 1\\xa0J\\xa0m −\\xa02 . These values are large compared to the only previously published value based on field measurements of 0.07\\xa0J\\xa0m −\\xa02 . However, comparison with an independent approach using a video sequence of one fracture test confirmed our results. Many more measurements are needed for a comprehensive dataset of weak layer fracture energy.',\n",

An online questionnaire hosted on a secure server was completed by 1418 young people (642 men and 776 women) aged 16–21 living in South-East England. Participants' scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were used to classify them as non-drinkers, former-drinkers, low-risk drinkers or hazardous drinkers. Multinomial logistic regression identified eight significant multivariate correlates that explained 39% of the variance in men's AUDIT category membership (χ2(24) = 263.32, p < .01), and seven significant multivariate correlates that explained 41% of the variance in women's AUDIT category membership (χ2(21) = 332.91, p < .01). The results suggest that non-drinkers and former-drinkers are more similar to each other than they are to both low risk and hazardous drinkers. We should not, therefore, treat these groups of young people as representing a drinking continuum. In particular, interventions for high risk young drinkers may be more effective if distinguished from general campaigns intended for all young people.\",\n",

Zika virus infections also have been documented through intrauterine transmission resulting in congenital infection; intrapartum transmission from a viremic mother to her newborn; sexual transmission; blood transfusion; and laboratory exposure (1-3). Most Zika virus infections are asymptomatic or result in mild clinical illness, characterized by acute onset of fever, maculopapular rash, arthralgia, or nonpurulent conjunctivitis; Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and severe thrombocytopenia rarely have been associated with Zika virus infection (1). However, congenital Zika virus infection can result in fetal loss, microcephaly, and other birth defects (1,2). In 2016, a total of 5,168 noncongenital Zika virus disease cases were reported from U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Most cases (4,897, 95%) were in travelers returning from Zika virus-affected areas. A total of 224 (4%) cases were acquired through presumed local mosquitoborne transmission, and 47 (1%) were acquired by other routes. It is important that providers in the United States continue to test symptomatic patients who live in or recently traveled to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission or had unprotected sex with someone who lives in or traveled to those areas.

A comparison of transport indices from five sample stations reveals that this typhoon significantly strengthened sediment transport, although the transport in predominate direction (TWCnorth branch) occurs all year. Moreover, findings from a comprehensive impact of currents, topography, test size and shape, as well as other abiotic factors, show that transport occurs in the order (from stronger to weaker): south-north path ≫ southeast-northwest path\\u2009>\\u2009nearshore-northeast path. Along the south-north path, the TWCnorth branch transports larger tests of taxa Ammonia compressiuscula and Cavarotalia annectens as bed load along the gentle seabed in a rolling or saltating process. Results from the southeast-northwest path show smaller and bulging tests of the dominant species Epistominella naraensis and Bolivina robusta may be transported as suspension load along the steep submarine valley by the TWCnorthwest branch. On the nearshore-northeast path, only part of allochthonous tests Ammonia beccarii vars. was transported, probably due to distance travelled and weakening of the typhoon. Furthermore, we also infer the northeastern area as a sink zone that accumulates grains of allochthonous tests predominantly from the southern source zone, and a selection of tests from littoral species originating from the nearshore source zone. It is important to identify and independently count allochthonous test samples if a large number of these tests are recorded. Findings from this study provide a reference to identify and investigate typhoon modern effects in areas with complex currents and frequent strong physical dynamic events, as well as their geological records.',\n",

It can image bone erosions and osteophytes, tendons, entheses, synovium and cartilaginous structures in multiple joints in a cheap, convenient examination within the clinic; it can also assist in interventions such as joint and tendon sheath injection. This has altered clinical practice in several contexts. Evaluation of subclinical synovitis is valuable to define the extent of inflammatory disease. In early arthritis clinics, inflammatory changes and bone erosion can be used to identify patients who need early aggressive immunosuppressive therapy. In established inflammatory arthritis, the presence of inflammatory changes during clinical remission predicts longer term outcomes and may allow stratification of therapy changes. Ultrasound has also elucidated pathological processes, for example in the structures involved in dactylitis or the subtypes of lupus arthritis. In specific complex joints, such as the shoulder, ultrasound allows a dynamic evaluation of multiple structures and a more precise diagnosis of pathology than clinical examination alone or other imaging techniques. In this article, we review the structures and pathologies that are well imaged by ultrasound, and its principal applications in the rheumatology clinic.',\n",

It was evidenced also that flagellin from different P. mirabilis strains differed in their capacity to induce an innate immune response in the CacoCCL20-Luc system. Also, flagellin elicited inflammation, with recruitment of leukocytes to the bladder epithelium. Flagellin instillation before an experimental P. mirabilis infection showed that the inflammatory response due to flagellin did not help to clear the infection but favored bacterial colonization.

The study focussed on cancer therapy-induced male infertility and curative effect of the extract with an appraisal on any possible revitalizing effects on sperm count, morphology, motility, and viability combined with hormonal and histopathological investigations.       Materials and methods   Male Wistar rats were used for the study. Two different doses of 400 mg/kg/d and 800 mg/kg/d (both p.o.) of the Hydroalcoholic extract were chosen as test dose while Clomiphene (25 mg/kg/d; p.o.) treatment served as standard treatment. Animals were initially injected with cisplatin (1 mg/kg/d; i.p.) for 15 days and the drug treatment was begun at the 16th day and continued till 43rd day (28 days treatment). Later all male animals got cohabited with female animals in the ratio 1:3. On confirmation of mating, female animals were isolated. Male animals were euthanized on batches. Testis and epididymis were weighed and homogenized. Sperm count, motility, morphology, viability, and headcount. The serum collected was evaluated for serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels. On day Gestational day 15, gravid uterus observations were calculated to evaluate male and female fertility parameters.       Results   There were statistically significant improvements (p\\u202f       Conclusion   Consolidating the results seen, the extract ameliorated the testicular toxicity caused by cisplatin in a dose-dependent manner. Further insight and evaluation of the phytochemicals of the pods should be performed to bring up commercial viability.',\n",

The radioisotope 57Co is selected to probe the diffusion behaviour in a series of HCP alloys, from equiatomic binary (HfZr) and ternary (HfTiZr) to quinary Al5Sc20Hf25Ti25Zr25 at.% and Al15Sc10Hf25Ti25Zr25 at.% high-entropy alloys. Diffusion of Co in the present alloys is found to be strongly anisotropic and exceptionally fast (by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude faster than self-diffusion) which can be explained in terms of a dissociative diffusion mechanism. The origin of ultra-fast diffusion of Co in the given HCP high-entropy alloys and the impact of the multi-element environment on the interstitial positions are analyzed in the framework of ab initio computations. Our results show that solute diffusion can be used as a tool to probe potential short range order in HCP multi-principal element alloys on very short time scales with respect to the jump rates of matrix atoms.',\n",

This study reports the results of the procedure.       Materials and methods   This retrospective study reported the patients with dorsal capsule tears between October 2011 and September 2014. The procedure was performed on outpatient under local regional anesthesia. The diagnosis is done arthroscopically. We always found a large rupture of the dorsal capsule with direct vision of the extensor tendons from the radiocarpal joint. The reparation is performed by a dorsal capsuloligamentous repair after enlarging the 3–4 portal.       Results   Sixteen procedures were performed on 15 patients, which represent 2% of the wrist arthroscopy. One was excluded because the follow-up was done abroad. There were 7 men and 7 women, mean age 27,9 years old (14–43). The surgery was performed on average 21 months after the accident (2–96). The clinical examination was not specific, neither the imaging. The diagnosis was performed arthroscopically. The scapholunate ligament was intact from the radiocarpal joint in 46,6%. In the midcarpal joint, we reported 4 stage 1 with EWAS classification, 2 stage 2B, 1 stage 3A, 4 stage 3B, 1 stage 3\\xa0C and 1 stage 4. A peripheral lesion of the TFCC was reported in 6 cases. A splint was worn on average 47.8 days. The average follow-up was 7.75 months (1.5–32.5). The range of motion and strength improved in all cases. The pain decreased from 6.3 u (4–8) to 0.9 (0–2) and the dash from 44.5 (20,45–95,45) to 6.25 (0–27,27). All radiographs were normal at the longest follow-up. We reported two Sudeck syndromes.       Discussion   Diagnosis of chronic wrist pain is difficult. More often, they are due to posttraumatic lesions - fracture or ligamentous tears, which lead both to arthrosis. A large dorsal capsule tear is one of the etiology, and its diagnosis was made possible thanks to arthroscopy, others paraclinic exams being poor.       Conclusion   Large dorsal capsule rupture could explain some non-diagnosed wrist pain. The diagnosis is arthroscopic. Arthroscopic suture avoids stiffness related to open surgery. These encouraging preliminary results require a larger serie with longer follow-up.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Background   Autism is a heterogeneous collection of disorders with a complex molecular underpinning. Evidence from postmortem brain studies have indicated that early prenatal development may be altered in autism. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from individuals with autism with macrocephaly also indicate prenatal development as a critical period for this condition. But little is known about early altered cellular events during prenatal stages in autism.       Methods   iPSCs were generated from 9 unrelated individuals with autism without macrocephaly and with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, and 6 typically developing control individuals. iPSCs were differentiated toward either cortical or midbrain fates. Gene expression and high throughput cellular phenotyping was used to characterize iPSCs at different stages of differentiation.       Results   A subset of autism-iPSC cortical neurons were RNA-sequenced to reveal autism-specific signatures similar to postmortem brain studies, indicating a potential common biological mechanism. Autism-iPSCs differentiated toward a cortical fate displayed impairments in the ability to self-form into neural rosettes. In addition, autism-iPSCs demonstrated significant differences in rate of cell type assignment of cortical precursors and dorsal and ventral forebrain precursors. These cellular phenotypes occurred in the absence of alterations in cell proliferation during cortical differentiation, differing from previous studies. Acquisition of cell fate during midbrain differentiation was not different between control- and autism-iPSCs.       Conclusions   Taken together, our data indicate that autism-iPSCs diverge from control-iPSCs at a cellular level during early stage of neurodevelopment. This suggests that unique developmental differences associated with autism may be established at early prenatal stages.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction: Care pathways are tools to coordinate and integrate care. All care pathways consist of multiple interventions. Adherence to these interventions is sometimes difficult in practice, leading to variation and underuse of care. This leaves room for improvement. An Important-Performance-Analysis (IPA) helps to set the improvement priorities for integrated care teams. The goal of this presentation is to show the potential of using IPA to identify improvement priorities. This is illustrated with an example on colorectal cancer surgery.   Theory/methods: We performed a retrospective, cross sectional measurement in 12 hospitals in 4 countries to determine the variation and do the IPA in perioperative care for colorectal cancer surgery. Relevant interventions and indicators (e.g. nutritional screening, early mobilization) were determined based on a model care pathway. Data was collected from patient record analysis, and intervention adherence was analyzed.   In the IPA, all interventions from the model pathway were mapped in a matrix. The importance dimension is showed on the Y-axis, and is defined by the strength of the recommendation of each intervention, ranging from 1-5 (cut off ≥3). The performance dimension, on the X-axis, is defined by the adherence rate: in which percentage of patients was the intervention actually performed (cut off ≥70%)? This results in a 2-by-2 matrix, with the top-right quadrant showing interventions that are important and have a high adherence.   Results: In total, 230 patients were included. The overall median protocol adherence was 44% (range 16-75%). Only 1 patient received more than 70% of the recommended care.   The IPA showed only 6 out of 45 interventions in the top right quadrant. Over half of the interventions had an importance of ≥ 3, and an adherence of less than 70%, placing them in the top-left quadrant. This is the quadrant which shows underuse, or ‘missed care’.   Discussion: Our study shows wide variation in perioperative care for colorectal surgery, in 12 European hospitals, and an overall protocol adherence of 44%. This is a serious problem, since a ‘dose effect relation’ between protocol adherence and outcomes has been shown in previous research, where adherence rates of 70% and higher increased survival. Hence the cut off of 70% for ‘importance’.   However, there is ongoing debate about the relevance of all interventions in the protocol. An IPA gives a visual representation of adherence versus importance, and therefor helps in focusing improvement activities.   Conclusions: There is considerable variation in perioperative care for colorectal cancer surgery, and low protocol adherence. An Importance-Performance-Analysis is an intuitive and novel approach to visually represent the variation and adherence, and to show the improvement priorities. This method will support integrated care teams to focus their quality improvement initiatives.   Lessons Learned:   - Variation and low protocol adherence threaten quality of care   - Import-Performance-Analysis provides an intuitive way to visualize ‘missed care’   - Setting the cut-off points in IPA can be challenging   Limitations: A limitation of our study comes from the retrospective design. Shortcomings in clinical registration may have led to under-documentation, resulting in an underestimation of protocol adherence.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction   Myocarditis is often an elusive diagnosis as the clinical presentation can be nonspecific and definitive diagnosis can be challenging due to the low sensitivity of endomyocardial biopsy. Additionally, treatment of myocarditis is controversial with no guidelines and limited data available regarding efficacy. Nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated a treatment benefit with immunosuppression, particularly in giant cell myocarditis (GCM). This report highlights a unique case of histologically confirmed GCM in which the patient also had a significant peripheral hypereosinophilia, and examines the response of combined immunosuppression with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (RATG), corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and benralizumab–an interleukin-5 receptor antagonist–that resulted in rapid recovery.       Case Report   A 25 year old woman with a history of asthma for 3 years and a recent diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (40%) presented with acute chest pain and worsening left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with a reduction of her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 25-30% within 2 weeks. Laboratory studies revealed a 40% peripheral eosinophilia. Further workup was negative for infection, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or malignancy. A cardiac MRI showed late-gadolinium enhancement and an endomyocardial biopsy confirmed significant eosinophilic tissue infiltration, myocyte necrosis, and the presence of giant cells. She was treated with a combined immunosuppression regimen of RATG induction, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and benralizumab. Despite this regimen, she had a recurrence of peripheral eosinophilia during the course of her hospitalization. Nevertheless, she had significant clinical improvement in symptomatology, functional status, and hemodynamics. Her peripheral eosinophilia resolved over the following days with increased corticosteroids and thereafter remained negligible. A repeat echocardiogram 3 weeks after initial initiation of immunosuppression demonstrated significant improvement in her LVEF to 53%, improvement of global strain, and reduction of left atrial dilatation.       Discussion   Emerging data suggests that treatment with immunosuppression can improve outcomes in patients with GCM. Indeed, this patient did have a marked improvement in LV function within 3 weeks of initiating treatment. Additionally, the use of benralizumab to treat her peripheral eosinophilia demonstrates potential implications for use in other hypereosinophilic syndromes. However, given that her serum eosinophila recurred despite being on a multi-drug immunosuppression regimen, including benralizumab, identifies potential focus areas of future research including further examination of the exact mechanism of action, the relevance of expanded use in other hypereosinophilic syndromes, and delineation of appropriate end points for measuring response.',\n",

Quality research methodology was employed using 17 key informants for in-depth interviews and focus-group discussion. Data analysis was carried out using the triangulation technique and content analysis. The results of the study revealed that the guidelines for the application of local wisdom to promote the added value of coconut products based on a creative economy were classified based on the stages of the production processes. The first stage was the primary stage of production using good-quality production factors for good agricultural practices, and effective productivity with the best produce; further, agricultural resources should be easily found locally. Second, a stage for promoting added value by adding quantitative and qualitative values, as well as the availability of opportunities and choices based on a creative economy, should be created. Third, a stage for commercial marketing by launching products that meet marketing needs and have a positive image according to the consumers’ perspectives should also be created. These processes should rely on the application of local wisdom to promote added value under the following circumstances: changes in nature and in the environment, ways of life and work, and the development or improvement of indigenous knowledge, which causes reduced expenditure, increases in income, and multiple opportunities and diversified alternatives.',\n",

However, TAVI still faces problems relating to durability, the potential incidence of thrombosis, and the inconvenience of storage in glutaraldehyde (Glut) solution. In this work, a tough hydrogel poly(N-acryloyl glycinamide) (pNAGA) is hybridized with Glut-crosslinked porcine pericardium (Glut-PP) via in situ polymerization and glycerolization, so as to obtain dry leafet material for the fabrication of a pre-mounted bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV). The tensile strength, anti-shearing, and anti-tearing properties of the valve are significantly improved by the process of hydrogel hybridization. Following a period of dry-state compression as a simulation for the crimping process of pre-mounted TAV, pNAGA/Glut-PP showed full recovery without structural damage when fully rehydrated. The introduction of pNAGA also improved the blood compatibility of the tissue, with less clot formation and fewer blood cells adhering to the surface of pNAGA/Glut-PP than is found with Glut-PP. Subcutaneous implantation in rats showed that pNAGA/Glut-PP induced a decreased inflammatory response compared with Glut-PP. These results indicate that the strategy for hybridization with hydrogel could be a potential method for preparing pre-mounted TAVs with an improved performance.',\n",

Objectives   To assess individual-level and school-level risk factors for symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis and compare them to corresponding associations with symptoms of asthma and eczema in Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood.       Methods   We studied 116,863 children aged 6–7 years from 2163 schools in 59 centres and 22 countries and 224,436 adolescents aged 13–14 years from 2037 schools in 97 centres in 41 countries. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted with random intercepts for school, centre, and country, adjusting for sex and maternal education at the child level. Associations between symptoms and a range of lifestyle and environmental risk factors were assessed for both the child's exposure and mean exposure at the school. Models were fitted for rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, and eczema singly (unimorbidity) and for combinations of these conditions (multimorbidity).       Results   Generally, associations between symptoms and exposures at the school level were similar in direction and magnitude to those at the child level. Associations with multimorbidity were stronger than for unimorbidity, particularly in individuals with symptoms of all three diseases, but risk factor associations found in conventional single disease analyses persisted among children with only one condition, after excluding multimorbid groups.   Comparisons of individuals with only one disease showed that many risk factor associations were consistent across the three conditions. More strongly associated with asthma were low birthweight, cat exposure in infancy, and current maternal smoking. Current paracetamol use was more strongly associated with asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis than eczema. Breastfeeding was more strongly associated with eczema than asthma or rhinoconjunctivitis.   The direction and magnitude of most risk factor associations were similar in affluent and non-affluent countries, although notable exceptions include farm animal contact in infancy and larger sibships, which were associated with increased risk of rhinoconjunctivitis in non-affluent countries but reduced risk in affluent countries. In both age groups, current paracetamol use increased risk of each disease to a greater extent in affluent countries than in non-affluent countries. Effects of paracetamol and antibiotics in infancy were more consistent between richer and poorer settings.       Conclusions   Most of the environmental and lifestyle correlates of rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and eczema in childhood display similarity across the three conditions, even in less affluent settings where allergic sensitisation is less likely to explain the concordant epidemiological patterns.

       "  'abstract': 'Ecological civilisation construction is a strategy for regional sustainable development based on a regional system of human-land relations. The comprehensive measurement and regional differentiation in construction levels are the key issues of ecological civilisation construction. This study aims to build 35 index systems that coalesce on four aspects: ecological economic adjustment and operation, ecological and social development and progress, ecological resources and environmental security, and ecological institutional and cultural awareness. We measured and evaluated the level of ecological civilisation construction of 329 cities (prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures and leagues) in 2018 using a comprehensive evaluation system and a spatial autocorrelation method to assess spatial differences in the level of ecological civilisation construction across China. This approach takes ‘the humanities-economic geography’ comprehensive perspective and uses a GWR (geographically weighted regression) model to analyse 10 influencing factors. Results show that: 1) the level of ecological construction can be divided into five types: higher, high, medium, low, and lower levels, according to the evaluation score. The five types are spindle-shaped in quantity and there is a significant imbalance in their spatial distribution, mainly trending from the southeast coast to the northwest. The land is decreasing, and the southern region is higher in level than the northern region. 2) The results of the spatial autocorrelation method show obvious spatial differences in ecological civilisation construction across China and that the level of ecological civilisation construction is positively autocorrelated. From east to west, the hot zone gradually transitions to a cold zone. A high-high type is mainly distributed in eastern coastal cities of China, and the number of high-low and low-high types are small. The low-low type is mainly distributed in the northwestern and northeastern regions. 3) The effect of influencing factors is heterogeneous in their spatial distribution, and the abundance of ecological resources is the most influential factor. According to the main influencing factors, each region should adhere to the principle of differentiation according to local conditions when choosing its ecological civilisation construction path and establishing an assessment mechanism. This study provides a scientific basis for enriching the regional level measurement of ecological civilisation construction, clarifying the current level of ecological civilisation construction in China, and implementing the regional differentiation path of ecological civilisation construction.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction: An increased risk of dental caries and periodontal diseases has been reported for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and are challenging conditions to manage.Areas covered: The authors searched international databases to find all studies assessing dental/periodontal outcomes in patients with IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), as well as the association between IMID medications and dental/periodontal status.Expert opinion: IBD are associated with a higher risk of both periodontitis and caries. Some evidence from rheumatoid arthritis suggests that periodontitis may be associated with a lower response to anti-TNF. There is no reliable evidence that IBD patients may be at greater risk of complications during routine dental care. On the basis of current data, guidelines can be proposed for the dental management focusing on the detection and eradication of infectious foci prior to the implementation of immunosuppressants/biologics and modified dental treatment protocol for invasive dental procedures that includes antibiotic prophylaxis.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper proposes a new haptic shared control concept between the human driver and the automation for lane keeping in semi-autonomous vehicles. Based on the principle of human-machine interaction during lane keeping, the level of cooperativeness for completion of driving task is introduced. Using the proposed human-machine cooperative status along with the driver workload, the required level of haptic authority is determined according to the driver’s performance characteristics. Then, a time-varying assistance factor is developed to modulate the assistance torque, which is designed from an integrated driver-in-the-loop vehicle model taking into account the yaw-slip dynamics, the steering dynamics, and the human driver dynamics. To deal with the time-varying nature of both the assistance factor and the vehicle speed involved in the driver-in-the-loop vehicle model, a new l∞ linear parameter varying control technique is proposed. The predefined specifications of the driver-vehicle system are guaranteed using Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed haptic shared control method is validated under various driving tests conducted with high-fidelity simulations. Extensive performance evaluations are performed to highlight the effectiveness of the new method in terms of driver-automation conflict management.',\n",

Material and method:we used anonymous questionnaires to teachers of Urziceni(group A) and Bucharest(group B),repeated at an interval of ten years(2001 and 2011).   Results:Teachers smoking prevalence was 45.4 %in 2001(47.9%in group A;43.3 %in group B) and 23.5 %in 2011(21.7 % group A;24.7 %- group B). Prevalence by gender was similar for group B(42.6 %M/43.9 %F) and higher for males in group A(60.6%M;39.2%F) in 2001.In 2011 the prevalence M/F was:39.3%/19.0 % for A and 28.8 %/23.2 %for B.In 2001almost 90% of smoking teachers consumed tobacco inside school,while in 2011 only 4 %of teachers smoking in school.Nicotine dependence was high at 44.8% of subjects in 2001( 45.7 %-A;43.9 %-B).In 2011 38.6% of them were highly dependent. The level of knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking on health was definitely better in 2011 than 2001.It should be noted that 10.4% of teachers were ex-smokers in 2001 respectivelly 18.9% in 2011.   Conclusions:Considerable decrease of tobacco consumption in teachers over the past decade can be correlated with a better health education-information campaigns conducted in schools in recent years.   Also amending legislation on tobacco was efficient-banning smoking in schools,ban on tobacco media advertising.   Initiation of national anti-tobacco program,including free counseling and treatment for smokers also helped a number of teacher to quit smoking.

The complex was characterized in the solid state by melting point, FT-IR, X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) analysis, 119Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, and Thermogravimetry/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG-DTA) and in solution by UV-Vis, 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques and Electrospray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS). The crystal structure of CIPTIN and its processor HCIP was also determined by X-ray crystallography. The antibacterial activity of CIPTIN, HCIP·HCl, HCIP and DPTD was evaluated against the bacterial species Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), by the means of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) and Inhibition Zones (IZs). CIPTIN shows lower MIC values than those of HCIP·HCl (up to 4.2-fold), HCIP (up to 2.7-fold) or DPTD (>135-fold), towards the tested microbes. CIPTIN is classified into bactericidal agents according to MBC/MIC values. The developing IZs are 40.8 ± 1.5, 34.0 ± 0.8, 36.0 ± 1.1 and 42.7 ± 0.8 mm, respectively which classify the microbes P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus and S. epidermidis to susceptible ones to CIPTIN. These IZs are greater than the corresponding ones of HCIP·HCl by 1.1 to 1.5-fold against both the tested Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. CIPTIN eradicates the biofilm of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus more efficiently than HCIP·HCl and HCIP. The in vitro toxicity and genotoxicity of CIPTIN were tested against human skin keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) (IC50 = 2.33 μM). CIPTIN exhibits 2 to 9-fold lower MIC values than its IC50 against HaCaT, while its genotoxic effect determined by micronucleus assay is equivalent to the corresponding ones of HCIP·HCl or HCIP.',\n",

Methods   We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL for peer-reviewed communications, letters, and manuscripts published during the COVID-19 pandemic evaluating medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases. We appraised assessment and reporting of medication adherence according to established definitions of three distinct problems of medication taking (i.e., non-initiation, poor implementation, and discontinuation) and pooled findings using random effects models.   Results   We included 31 peer-reviewed studies in our synthesis from various jurisdictions, of which 25 described medication taking among rheumatology patients and 6 described medication prescribing among rheumatology providers. The pooled prevalence of overall medication non-adherence was 14.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 12.3%, 17.2%) and that of medication discontinuation (i.e., stopping of prescriptions) and poor implementation (i.e., not taking medication at the dose/frequency prescribed) as 9.5% (CI: 5.1%, 14.0%) and 9.6% (CI: 6.2%, 13.0%), respectively. Non-initiation (i.e., not starting/not filling new prescriptions) was not addressed.   Conclusions   Medication taking among individuals with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic varies globally. Unclear reporting and extensive variation in research methods between studies creates barriers to research replication, comparison, and generalization to specific patient populations. Future research in this area should use consistent and transparent approaches to defining and measuring medication taking problems in order to ensure findings appropriately describe the epidemiology of medication adherence and have the potential to identify modifiable targets for improving patient care.\",\n",

The use of conventional corrosion inhibitors have been very effective in protecting bottom of the pipelines but insufficiently transported to 10-2 o?clock position of the pipes leading to continuous corrosion process at the upper part of the pipe. Therefore the use of volatile corrosion inhibitor has been encouraged because of their low molecular weight and high vapour pressure which makes it easier to be transported to the upper part of the pipe to reduce corrosion rate.   The efficiency of methyl di ethanol amine (MDEA) and mono ethylene glycol (MEG) as volatile corrosion inhibitors have been simulated in the laboratory using two-electrode electrochemical cell configuration in CO2 and acetic acid environments (with addition of volatile corrosion inhibitors). There is a progressive reduction in corrosion rate with time in CO2 environment due to the formation of protective iron carbonate film on the metal surface which reduces further corrosion process.   Presence of acetic acid changes the corrosion mechanism which resulted in formation of porous and non-protective iron acetate that further increases the corrosion rate due to the solubility of the complex iron acetate in acidified water. Addition of either MDEA or MEG volatile corrosion inhibitor further decreases the corrosion rate in CO2 environment. However, both inhibitors are ineffective in acetic acid containing environment. It could be established that the presence of acetic acid breaks down the protective iron carbonate film which are difficult to be re-formed with the addition of volatile corrosion inhibitors',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Most existing image sparse approximation methods can reach their best performance only under the condition that the image has some certain properties. In addition, for the remote sensing image, it is difficult to obtain a good sparse result if it contains a lot of details. Focused on the two problems, in this paper, a novel hybrid method that is of some generality is proposed. The method exploits the advantages of the tensor product wavelet transform for representation of smooth images and the ability of the tetrolet transform to represent texture and edge effectively at the same time. Moreover, two specialized processes of decomposition are designed, which contribute to increasing the energy concentration further and preserving the information of the details as much as possible. The procedure of the proposed hybrid method is as follows: for a given remote sensing image, first, the usual tensor product wavelet transform is used, then the redundancy among adjacent wavelet coefficients is removed by making a polyphase decomposition to each subband with a p-fold filter, and after that, the approximation of the low frequency image can be obtained by reconstructing those preserved coefficients. Second, for the detailed image, the sparse decomposition is carried out by the tetrolet transform. For the high frequency subbands, an adaptive decomposition will be done for increasing the energy aggregation. After that, the approximation of the detailed image can be obtained by reconstructing those preserved coefficients. Numerical results indicate the high effectiveness of the procedure for remote sensing image sparse approximation.',\n",

Methods   A total of 185 subjects were examined, and IR was quantified by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Multivariate hierarchical approach was performed, and five distinct levels were recognized, namely, immutable demographic features and early life parameters, current anthropometric measures, IR, unfavorable clinical conditions, and social parameters. Two analyses were performed based on HOMA-IR cut-off values (3.16 and, as an alternative, 3.99).   Results   Obesity was associated with IR (adjusted OR=3.19, 95% CI: 1.12-9.09). IR steadily predicted low HDL (adjusted OR=5.75, 95% CI: 1.58-20.87), hypertriglyceridemia (adjusted OR=10.28, 95% CI: 1.18-89.55), and systolic hypertension. At the alternative analysis, IR was also associated with older age, older age at menarche, hyperuricemia, and low school grades.   Conclusion   Emerging on the grounds of obesity, IR confers risks for dyslipidemia and hypertension at a relatively early age.

This work gives a detailed insight into a novel wireless body sensor network and addresses critical aspects such as signal quality, synchronicity among multiple devices as well as the system's overall capabilities and limitations in cardiovascular monitoring. An early sign of typical cardiovascular diseases is often shown by disturbed autonomic regulations such as orthostatic intolerance. In that context, blood pressure measurements play an important role to observe abnormalities like hypo- or hypertensions. Non-invasive and unobtrusive blood pressure monitoring still poses a significant challenge, promoting alternative approaches including pulse wave velocity considerations. In the scope of this work, the presented hardware is applied to demonstrate the continuous extraction of multi modal parameters like pulse arrival time within a preliminary clinical study. A Schellong test to diagnose orthostatic hypotension which is typically based on blood pressure cuff measurements has been conducted, serving as an application that might significantly benefit from novel multi-modal measurement principles. It is further shown that the system's synchronicity is as precise as 30 μs and that the integrated analog preprocessing circuits and additional accelerometer data provide significant advantages in ambulatory measurement environments.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': \"AIMS/INTRODUCTION This study aimed to investigate the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in insulin-treated type\\xa01 diabetes patients administered sodium-glucose cotransporter\\xa02 (SGLT2) inhibitors in real-world clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS We carried out a real-world, retrospective, observational cohort study using Japanese Medical Data Vision, a diagnosis procedure combination database. We identified insulin-treated adult type\\xa01 diabetes patients enrolled from December 2018 to October 2019. We assessed the incidence and risk of DKA in type\\xa01 diabetes patients using SGLT2 inhibitors in an 'on-label' manner. Cox multivariate regression analyses were carried out to determine clinical factors linked to SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA. RESULTS Of 11,475 type\\xa01 diabetes patients, 1,898 (16.5%) were prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors. DKA occurred in 139 (7.3%) of these patients, with 20.2 incidences per 100 person-years. These patients also showed significantly higher DKA rates than did those not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (hazard ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.33-2.06; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001). The mean time until DKA onset in SGLT2 inhibitor-treated type\\xa01 diabetes patients was 30.6\\xa0±\\xa030.1\\xa0days. The risk of SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA increased in type\\xa01 diabetes patients irrespective of sex, age or body mass index. However, the risk did not increase in type\\xa01 diabetes patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, which warrants further investigation because of the small number of type\\xa01 diabetes patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. CONCLUSIONS 'On-label' SGLT2 inhibitor use might increase DKA risk among insulin-treated type\\xa01 diabetes patients irrespective of sex, age or body mass index. Both type\\xa01 diabetes patients and healthcare providers should be wary of DKA, especially during the first month of initiating SGLT2 inhibitors.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Introduction and Objectives   Asthma is a condition that involves airway inflammation leading to variable bronchial constriction. It is well-established that blood eosinophil counts are often raised in patients with asthma and correlate with increased brochial hyperreactivity.1 However, blood eosinophils are not currently recommended for monitoring asthma in adults.2 Many patients admitted to hospital have undergone a full blood count in the year prior to their index attack and this is an easy opportunity to assess their risk of exacerbation and intervene.   Methods   We elected to review patients admitted to hospital at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust over a 12-month period. We investigated whether a full blood count was available and also, if there was evidence of raised blood eosinophil counts. We also recorded information on treatment and length of stay.   Results   197 patients were included, 58 female and 139 male, with a mean age of 50 years (range 12–13). A total of 135 (68.5%) patients had FBC recorded in the 12 months prior to admission. 87 (64.44%) of these had an eosinophil count of ≥0.3 at least once in the 12 month period. 70 (35.5%) patients had an eosinophil count of ≥0.3 on admission. The average eosinophil count over the 12 months prior to admission was 0.36 (range 0–3.1). Patients with an eosinophil count of ≥0.3 were more likely to be using LABA+ICS combination than their counterparts (51.43% vs 44.09%). No significant difference was noted with other therapies.   Conclusion   A high proportion of patients admitted to hospital had a historical FBC available. Two-thirds had recorded an eosinophil count of ≥0.3 in the 12 months leading up to admission suggesting an increased risk of a severe asthma exacerbation. There is an opportunity to intervene to prevent future exacerbations. An incidental raised blood eosinophil count in asthmatics should be regarded as a red flag for future asthma attacks.

Unlike traditional sodium channel blockers affecting fast inactivation, lacosamide selectively enhances sodium channel slow inactivation. This mechanism of action results in stabilization of hyperexcitable neuronal membranes, inhibition of neuronal firing, and reduction in long-term channel availability without affecting physiological function. Lacosamide has a well-characterized and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including a fast absorption rate, minimal or no interaction with cytochrome P-450 izoenzymes, and a low potential for drug–drug interactions. Lacosamide clinical development included three placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trials conducted in more than 1300 patients, each demonstrating safety and efficacy of lacosamide compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy for adults with POS. The clinical use of lacosamide may broaden, pending results of trials evaluating its use as monotherapy for POS in adults, as treatment for epilepsy in pediatric subjects, and as adjunctive treatment for uncontrolled primary generalized tonic–clonic seizures in those with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.',\n",

We find that the optimal Home tariff rate is strictly decreasing in the bargaining power of Home firms, and an increase in the Home firms׳ bargaining power might therefore raise Foreign profits. Under an endogenous market structure with entry followed by matching, the relationship between bargaining power and output is non-monotone if the demand function is strictly concave or convex.

These stem cells differentiate into mucous producing goblet cells, enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells or Paneth cells. Differentiation related to inflammatory stress has been well studied in the lung and liver but gut stem cell differentiation in IBD has only a small body of literature. Hypothesis: Changing environments in the TNBS mouse model of chronic colitis modulate the lineage of colonic mucosal stem cells. Methods: BALB/c mice were given weekly colonic exposure to TNBS, to induce colitis, or saline as a control. Colon, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from groups of mice (n=4-5) every other week from 5-17 weeks(W). Sections of tissue were prepared for microscopic, protein and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. Colonic muscle segments were isolated to assess smooth muscle contractility. BrdU was administered to each mouse 2 hours prior to harvest. Results: Mircoscopic analysis of TNBS-treated colon demonstrates increased submucosal cellularity and collagen deposition at 5W. This cellularity decreases but the collagen deposition is unchanged and is increasingly organized (strands) in the subsequent study intervals. During this time there was a 25% increase in thickness of the colonic mucosa and corresponding increase in the number of BdrU positive cells that peak at 15W. There are prominent goblet cells and significant mucous production associated with elevated levels of IL-13 and MUC2 and low levels of IL-2, IL-17, TGF β1 and TNFα. From 13-17W there was marked disruption of normal mucosal architecture. BrdU positive crypt cells drop precipitously at 17W coincident with a decrease in goblet cells and an increase in lymphocytic and stromal cells in the lamina propria. At this time there is a marked upregulation in IL-17, TNFα and IFNγ. Conclusions: The development of chronic inflammation is a transition phasing response to a changing microenvironment in the chronic mouse model. First, an acute inflammatory response is apparent at 5W. This is followed by a second mucosal proliferative phase characterized by proliferation of goblet cells due to elevated levels of IL-13. There is suppression of fibrosis during this period. The 3rd phase, evolving between 13-17W, is marked by architectural disruption, an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, a dramatic decrease in crypt goblet cell replication and a dramatic increase in stromal cellularity and fibrosis.\",\n",

Findings– Risk Score variable figures as the top of the variable importance list followed by length of employment as one of the more important variables in determining whether loans where eventually issued. Risk Score (at Origination) figures as the top of the variable importance list. This is followed by Amount Paid as a % of Loan Amount as one of the more important variables in determining whether loans would turn delinquent. The performance (accuracy) on training as well as test set is best given using the xgboost model at 99%.     Practical implication– The paper includes implications for the borrowers to understand the factors influencing the decisions of issuance of loan and for the investors to understand the reasons for delinquency in peer to peer lending.     Originality/value– This paper fulfills an identified need to build a model to predict probability of success in getting loans with identification of reasons for issuance of loans at Lending Club. Similarly, it also attempts to build a model to predict probability of delinquency and reasons contributing to delinquency to benefit investor’s community at Lending Club.',\n",

Although recent studies have documented changes in brain structure and function in male adolescents with CD, there have been no neuroimaging studies of female adolescents with CD. Our primary objective was to investigate whether female adolescents with CD show changes in grey matter volume. Our secondary aim was to assess for sex differences in the relationship between CD and brain structure.     Methods:? female adolescents with CD (n?=?22) and healthy control participants matched in age, performance IQ and handedness (n?=?20) underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. Group comparisons of grey matter volume were performed using voxel-based morphometry. We also tested for sex differences using archive data obtained from male CD and control participants.     Results:? female adolescents with CD showed reduced bilateral anterior insula and right striatal grey matter volumes compared with healthy controls. Aggressive CD symptoms were negatively correlated with right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volume, whereas callous-unemotional traits were positively correlated with bilateral orbitofrontal cortex volume. The sex differences analyses revealed a main effect of diagnosis on right amygdala volume (reflecting reduced amygdala volume in the combined CD group relative to controls) and sex-by-diagnosis interactions in bilateral anterior insula.   Conclusions:? We observed structural abnormalities in brain regions involved in emotion processing, reward and empathy in female adolescents with CD, which broadly overlap with those reported in previous studies of CD in male adolescents',\n",

       "  'abstract': '3-cube Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) method is the most extensively applied approach for live-cell FRET quantification. Reliable measurements of calibration factors are crucial for quantitative FRET measurement. We here proposed a modified TA-G method (termed as mTA-G) to simultaneously obtain the FRET-sensitized quenching transition factor (G) and extinction coefficients ratio (γ) between donor and acceptor. mTA-G method includes four steps: (1) Predetermining the ratio ranges of the sensitized emission of acceptor (FC ) to the donor excitation and donor channel image (IDD (DA)) for all FRET plasmids; (2) Culturing the cells which express every FRET plasmid in one dish respectively; (3) Distinguishing and marking the cells expressing different FRET plasmids by detecting their FC /IDD (DA) values; (4) Linearly fitting FC /IAA (DA) (acceptor excitation and acceptor channel image) to IDD (DA)/IAA (DA) for different kinds of cells. We implemented mTA-G method by imaging tandem constructs cells with different FRET efficiency cultured in one dish on different days, and obtained consistent G and γ values. mTA-G method not only circumvents switchover of different culture dishes but also keep the constant imaging conditions, exhibiting excellent robustness, and thus will expands the biological applications of quantitative FRET analysis in living cells.

On the basis of these works, in the present contribution, we construct an empirical database for acetylene in the 5850–9415\\xa0cm–1 region excluding the 6341–7000\\xa0cm−1 interval corresponding to the very strong ν1+ν3 manifold. Our database gathers and extends information included in our CRDS and FTS studies. In particular, the intensities of about 1700 lines measured by CRDS in the 7244–7920\\xa0cm−1 region are reported for the first time together with those of several bands of 12C13CH2 present in natural isotopic abundance in the acetylene sample.   The Herman-Wallis coefficients of most of the bands are derived from a fit of the measured intensity values. A recommended line list is provided with positions calculated using empirical spectroscopic parameters of the lower and upper energy vibrational levels and intensities calculated using the derived Herman-Wallis coefficients. This approach allows completing the experimental list by adding missing lines and improving poorly determined positions and intensities. As a result the constructed line list includes a total of 11113 transitions belonging to 150 bands of 12C2H2 and 29 bands of 12C13CH2. For comparison the HITRAN database in the same region includes 869 transitions of 14 bands, all belonging to 12C2H2. Our weakest lines have an intensity on the order of 10–29\\xa0cm/molecule, about three orders of magnitude smaller than the HITRAN intensity cut off. Line profile parameters are added to the line list which is provided in HITRAN format.   The comparison of the acetylene database to the HITRAN2012 line list or to results obtained using the global effective operator approach is discussed in terms of completeness and accuracy.',\n",

The flow is measured without using any kind of laminar or bypass elements and it has been tested for laminar, transitional and turbulent flow patterns. It contains four temperature sensors. Three of them are placed downstream and the fourth upstream. Results showed that the model qualitatively describes the relationship between temperature and mean velocity in laminar flows. The meter accuracy is increased by combining the flow estimations given by three downstream sensors (redundancy of measurements) and by continuously correcting the dependency that the calorimetric method shows on fluid temperature. Experimental results, using water as fluid, make the accuracy rate of the instrument equal to±0.7% FS in a range between 0.5\\xa0L/min and 19\\xa0L/min, which is not a usual range for thermal flowmeters in liquids.

Two “opposing” groups were defined for the study. The first, designated the bone group, was formed by seeding MSCs onto porous poly(l-lactide-co-e-caprolactone)/hydroxyapatite scaffolds. The second group, designated the cartilage group, was formed by encapsulating MSCs in 2% agarose. The samples were either subjected to hydrostatic pressure (HP), administered CM from the opposing group at a concentration of 50%, or given a combination of the two stimuli. The sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content and SOX9, aggrecan, and collagen type II expressions suggest that both osteoblast CM and intermittent HP individually enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. In addition, there is evidence of a synergistic interaction between CM and HP on chondrogenic differentiation. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein expression suggest that the combination of chondrocyte CM and HP significantly enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

Objective   To compare the relative potential of different physical pretreatments to enhance PPIX fluorescence in normal skin.   Design, Setting, and Participants   This intraindividual, randomized clinical trial was performed from November 28 to December 20, 2014, at Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, among 12 healthy volunteers 18 years or older. Analysis was based on intention to treat. All participants completed the study protocol.   Interventions   Participants were each exposed to standardized skin preparation with curettage, microdermabrasion with abrasive pads, microneedling with dermarollers, ablative fractional laser (AFXL), non-AFXL, and no pretreatment, followed by 3 hours of methyl aminolevulinate hydrochloride incubation and subsequent red light illumination.   Main Outcomes and Measures   The primary outcome measure was methyl aminolevulinate–induced PPIX fluorescence accumulation. Secondary outcome measures were PPIX photobleaching and clinical local skin reactions, supported by noninvasive reflectance measurements of percentage of skin redness, transepidermal water loss, and participant-assessed pain.   Results   Among the 12 healthy study participants (8 men; 4 women; mean [SD] age, 33 [15] years), histologic findings confirmed standardization of interventions with partial removal of the stratum corneum after curettage and microdermabrasion and similar vertical penetration depths for microneedling, AFXL, and non-AFXL (median, 125 μm). PPIX fluorescence reached highest intensities in skin pretreated with AFXL (median, 8661 arbitrary units [AU]) compared with microdermabrasion (median, 6731 AU), microneedling (median, 5609 AU), and curettage (median, 4765 AU) ( P   P     Conclusions and Relevance   Under standardized conditions, PPIX accumulation was most enhanced after AFXL pretreatment, followed by microdermabrasion, microneedling, and curettage.

However, the optimal diagnostic modality identifying these patients is still debated. None of the currently used modalities has been proved superior to another. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of two modalities, stump pressure measurement (SPM) versus electroencephalography (EEG) combined with transcranial Doppler (TCD) during CEA. Methods: Two retrospective cohorts of consecutive patients undergoing CEA with different intraoperative neuromonitoring strategies (SPM vs. EEG/TCD) were analyzed. Clinical data were collected from patient hospital records. Primary clinical outcome was in-hospital stroke or death. Total admission costs were calculated based on volumes of healthcare resources. Analyses of effects and costs were adjusted for clinical differences between patients by means of a propensity score, and cost-effectiveness was estimated. Results: A total of 503 (239 SPM; 264 EEG/TCD) patients were included, of whom 19 sustained a stroke or died during admission (3.3 vs. 4.2%, respectively, adjusted risk difference 1.3% (95% CI −2.3–4.8%)).

The MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data was used as an auxiliary data to supplement the analysis with surface measured PM2.5. The emission source inventory and meteorology datasets are also used and analyzed to examine the causes of changes in trends of PM2.5. The results revealed that the annually averaged values of AOD and surface PM2.5 concentrations over the high-polluted areas are decreasing year-by-year, with stable values found over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The decreasing trends of PM2.5 concentration and fine particle pollution frequency over the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) area are most obvious. Over the PRD region, PM2.5 concentration maintains below the annual air quality standard (35\\u202fμg/m3) with low fine particle pollution frequency. The decreasing trend of averaged PM2.5 in each region is closely related to the reduction of anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions. However, the fluctuated features in different season are mostly influenced by the meteorological conditions. Based on the weather type classifications observed from the COST733 model, the weather types under uniform pressure and eastern high pressure more likely resulted in the occurrence of fine particulate pollution over China. When the weather under the bottom with high pressure occurs, Northeast China (NEC) and BTH regions are most likely to be polluted, which is more likely to lead to heavy fine particle pollution events. The air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area is the most serious when the uniform pressure field weather occurs in winter.',\n",

A total of 24 pluriparous ewes had estrus induced by intravaginal sponges (60mg MAP, Progespon®, Syntex, Buenos Aires, Argentina) for six day plus 200IU eCG (Novormon 5000®, Syntex, Buenos Aires, Argentina) i.m. and 37.5µg d-cloprostenol (Prolise®, ARSA S.R.L., Buenos Aires, Argentina) latero-vulvar, 24h before sponge removal. The ewes were monitored for estrus detection from sponge removal at 12h interval end bred with fertile rams. Twelve hours after estrous onset, with the aid of Allis forceps, cervix were immobilized for traction and a HEGAR dilator was inserted into cervical ostiun to check the facility of transposing. After this, ewes were equally shared between to treatments according to body condition score and cervical transposing to be subjected to transcervical uterine flushing seven days after estrous onset. In Group (n=12; 6 ewes with cervical transposing), ewes received 37.5 µg d-cloprostenol latero-vulvar and 1mg estradiol benzoate (Estrogin®, Sao Paulo, Brazil) i.m. 16h before uterine flushing and 50 IU oxytocin (Ocitocina Forte UCB®, Sao Paulo, Brazil) i.v. 20min before uterine flushing. In Group 2 (n-12; 5 ewes with cervical transposition at estrus), ewes received the same treatment of the G1 but changing estradiol for 1 mL saline. Qualitative variables were analyzed by qui-square and the quantitative analysis of variance to check differences between treatments with means tested by t-test (5%, SAEG®). Parameters evaluated were similar for both groups (P>0.05). Estrous response was 100%. The interval from sponge removal to estrous onset and duration of estrus were 41.5±8.6 and 36.0±10.6 h, respectively. Cervical transposing at estrus was 46% (11/24). Successful uterine flushing was performed in 33% G1 (4/12) and 25% G2 (3/12) ewes. In successful and non-successful uterine flushed ewes 6.0±1.1 and 3.3±1.6 cervical rings were transposed, respectively. All G2 flushed had cervical transposing at estrus. Two successful uterine flushed G1 ewes had no cervical transposing at estrus. The efficiency of uterine flushing (liquid injected / recovered) was 94%. Embryo recovery varies from 0 to 3 structures (1.0±1.1) per flushing. With this study it is concluded that the technique of transcervical collection closed loop is possible in sheep because has satisfactory rate of washing performance.

Male Wistar strain white rats (Rattus novergicus Berkenhout) as the animal model. Three groups of newly weaned white rats (21 days old), which had been adapted for 4 days so they had the relatively average of weight (50.22 to 53.97 g) were used. Each group contained four individuals and they were fed different feeds, i.e., normal AIN coupled with 9% casein, normal AIN coupled with 1.8% fresh walnuts and normal AIN coupled with 1.8% dried roasted walnuts. Rat weights were measured every 2 days and feed consumption measured every day, for 28 days. Tukey’s HSD Test was used to compare treatments. The results showed that there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) between the PER treatment of AIN feed coupled with dried roasted walnuts (PER: 2.58) compared with AIN coupled with fresh walnuts treatment (PER : 2.54) and AIN added with casein (PER : 2.52), but those three treatments showed a higher PER value than the standard (2.50). Fresh walnuts or dried walnuts have PER value beyond the standard; thus walnuts can be categorized as a source of quality protein.',\n",

METHODS The experimental, randomised, controlled trial was conducted at the Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, from March 2009 to June 2009 and comprised rabbits acquired from the National Institute of Health, Islamabad. The animals were randomly divided into three equal groups: group A had controls, group B was treated with tamoxifen, and group C with tamoxifen plus retinoic acid. The uterine weight and cross-sectional diameter of uterine horns were measured after sacrifice. The uteri were processed for paraffin embedding. The sections were then assessed for stratification of glandular epithelium, changes in the glandular shape and glandular epithelial height. SPSS 13 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Tamoxifen administration resulted in variation of glandular shape and increase in glandular epithelial height in group B as compared to control group, p < 0.001 and 0.005 respectively. The adjuvant administration of 13-cis-retinoic acid showed a suppressive effect only on glandular epithelial height, when compared with Group B (p=0.01).

Many secondary metabolites, such as tea polyphenols, theanine, and caffeine that accumulated in tea leaves are beneficial to human health. The fresh leaves of tea plant are harvested and timely processed into tea products with different flavors. The withering of fresh tea leaves is the first step in tea processing and directly affects tea color, taste, and fragrance. To understand the molecular mechanism that influences tea quality during withering, we investigated the dynamic changes in the proteome of postharvest tea leaves in four withering stages (0, 1, 4, and 12\\xa0h treatments). A total of 863 unique differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified by iTRAQ. The up- and down-regulated DEPs and the protein–protein interaction networks in different samples presented dynamic changes in their characteristics. The results of the functional annotation revealed that the molecular characteristics of tea withering are similar to leaf senescence. The biosynthesis of main tea-specific compounds that constitute tea color, taste, and fragrance of tea is restricted during withering. The substance transformation and degradation may have positive contributions to tea quality in withering technology. The proteome dynamics can be a useful aid for understanding the withering mechanisms and providing available information for functional discovery of proteins in the future.',\n",

That is, decide what to explore and what to learn, identifying what constitutes potential useful data as examples of concepts or what strategy to follow to solve a new task. Different efforts have been developed in machine learning towards this aim. Approaches that introduce new concepts, like predicate invention in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques, normally require the selection of examples by the user. Techniques that learn behavior policies through exploration like Reinforcement Learning (RL) with intrinsic motivation, to guide the agent into interesting areas to discover new goals, assume that all the states and actions are predefined in advance. In this paper, we describe a system, called ADC, that combines techniques from ILP with predicate invention and RL with intrinsic motivation to discover new concepts, states and actions to learn behavior policies. ADC drives its own learning process, collecting its own examples for autonomously learning concepts. These new concepts can be used to describe its environment and define new states and actions used to learn behaviors to solve tasks.

These SCID pigs lack B-cells and T-cells, but possess Natural Killer (NK) cells. This SCID phenotype is caused by recessive mutations in the Artemis gene. Interestingly, two human tumor cell lines, PANC-1 and A375-SM, survived after injection into these SCID pigs, but, as we demonstrate here, these cells, as well as K562 tumor cells, can be lysed in vitro by NK cells from SCID and non-SCID pigs. NK cells from both SCID and non-SCID pigs required activation in vitro with either recombinant human IL-2 or the combination of recombinant porcine IL-12 and IL-18 to kill tumor targets. We also showed that SCID NK cells could be activated to produce perforin, and perforin production was greatly enhanced in NK cells from both SCID and non-SCID pigs after IL-2 cytokine treatment. While CD16+, CD172- NK cells constituted an average of only 4% in non-SCID pigs, NK cells averaged 27% of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell population in SCID pigs. We found no significant differences in killing activity per NK cell between SCID and non-SCID pigs.

Particular focus was placed on the role of bcl-2, p53, Ki-67. Methods: The study subjects, 94 women with TNBC, were a subset of patients operated at Kosin University Gospel Hospital from January 2000 to December 2005.

A total of 144 Latino children (95 children with typical language development and 49 children with language impairment) were tested using nonword lists developed for each language. The results show that the clinical accuracy of nonword repetition tasks varies depending on the language(s) tested. Test performance appeared related to individual differences in language use and exposure. The findings do not support a monolingual approach to the assessment of bilingual children with nonword repetition tasks, even if children appear fluent speakers in the language of testing.

       "  'abstract': 'Besides dynamical downscaling by regional climate models, statistical downscaling (SD) is a major tool to derive climate change projections on regional or even local scales. For the Mediterranean area, an increasing number of downscaling studies based on different statistical techniques have been published in the last two decades with a broad range of sometimes differing results relating to different variables and regional domains. This paper gives a short review of these Mediterranean downscaling studies mainly considering the following two aspects: (1) what kind of progress has been realized in this field since the early 1990s? The review addresses the inclusion of extremes in downscaling assessments, the development of probabilistic approaches, the extension of predictor sets, the use of ensembles for both dynamical model simulations and statistical model assessments, the consideration of non-stationarities in the predictor–predictand relationships, and some advances related to synoptic downscaling. (2) What are the main regional climate change signals in the Mediterranean area, considering agreed and controversial points also with respect to dynamical models? Best accordance among future projections can be found in seasonal temperatures with lower rates of warming in winter and spring, and, in most cases, higher ones in summer and autumn. Different results are obtained for the intra-annual range of extreme temperatures, but high-temperature conditions are generally expected to increase. Regarding seasonal precipitation, predominant reductions are indicated for spring, summer, and autumn. For winter, however, projections are distinctly different (GCMs: rainfall decrease; RCMs: increase only in the northernmost parts of the Mediterranean region; SD: widespread increases in the northern and western parts in several studies). Different results are obtained for rainfall extremes, but the entire precipitation distribution tends to shift towards higher and lower values. Apart from some sub-regional deviations, there is a predominant increase in future dry period durations. For near-surface winds, only a few studies are available, and they project some decline mainly for the winter season.',\n",

During the synthesis, CO 2   played the dual roles, one is to provide a simple physical expansion to evenly disperse the precursors onto the mesoporous carbon support, and the other is to offer some chemical groups such as CO 3   2   −   to facilitate the complete and uniform deposition through the coordination to the metallic cations with these anions. When used as anode material for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), the Co 3 O 4 /mC synthesized in CO 2 -expanded ethanol solution exhibited larger surface area and better cycle performance compared with the reference sample synthesized in pure ethanol. The enhanced cycle performance could be attributed to the synergistic effects between the superior structures of mesoporous C support and the highly dispersed Co 3 O 4   nanoparticles. More importantly, the synthesis of Co 3 O 4 /mC composite in CE solution was green and highly efficient, avoiding the use of precipitant and the aggregation of Co 3 O 4 , which would definitely enrich the strategies for the fabrication of carbon-based transition-metal oxide composites with great applications.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This paper presents a new fast algorithm for computing an approximation to the mean of two strings of characters representing a 2D shape and its application to a new Wilson-based editing procedure. The approximate mean is built up by including some symbols from the two original strings. In addition, a Greedy approach to this algorithm is studied, which allows us to reduce the time required to compute an approximate mean. The new dataset editing scheme relaxes the criterion for deleting instances proposed by the Wilson editing procedure. In practice, not all instances misclassified by their near neighbors are pruned. Instead, an artificial instance is added to the dataset in the hope of successfully classifying the instance in the future. The new artificial instance is the approximated mean of the misclassified sample and its same-class nearest neighbor. Experiments carried out over three widely known databases of contours show that the proposed algorithm performs very well when computing the mean of two strings, and outperforms methods proposed by other authors. In particular, the low computational time required by the heuristic approach makes it very suitable when dealing with long length strings. Results also show that the proposed preprocessing scheme can reduce the classification error in about 83% of trials. There is empirical evidence that using the Greedy approximation to compute the approximated mean does not affect the performance of the editing procedure.',\n",

Whereas systemic syphilis infection increases plasma HIV RNA levels (viral load; VL), effects of syphilis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) VL are unknown. We hypothesized that intrathecal immune activation in neurosyphilis would selectively increase CSF VL in coinfected patients. In this study, HIV-infected research subjects (N = 225) were categorized into three groups based on serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR), microhemaglutination for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP) MHA-TP, and CSF VDRL: 23 with neurosyphilis (NS+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP and positive CSF VDRL); 42 with systemic syphilis but not neurosyphilis (Syph+; reactive serum RPR and MHA-TP; negative CSF VDRL), and 160 without syphilis (Syph-; nonreactive serum RPR). Plasma and CSF HIV VL were quantified by reverse transcriptase-ploymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Amplicor, Roche) in log(10) copies/ml. To adjust for covariates previously shown to influence CSF HIV VL (i.e., plasma VL, CD4, pleocytosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), multivariable linear regression was used. Lumbar punctures (LP) done for research purposes diagnosed 23 with neurosyphilis; most (83%) of these reported prior syphilis treatment. Among subjects with detectable plasma VL, CSF VL was highest in NS+, followed by Syph+ and Syph- (P =.006). This relationship was independent of the level of plasma VL or CSF pleocytosis. By contrast, among subjects with undetectable plasma HIV VL, CSF VLs were similar in the three syphilis subgroups (P = .50). Neurosyphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation that persists even after syphilis treatment. Because elevated CSF VL is associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline, future studies should evaluate the impact of neurosyphilis on the course of central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection.',\n",

The results were compared with the ultrasonographic data collected from 5 cows with omasal impaction, as confirmed at necropsy. On moving the transducer dorsoventrally in each intercostal space and below the costal arch, the wall of omasum could be seen as an echogenic arc-like structure. The difference between mean dorsoventral extents of the normal and impacted omasums was statistically insignificant.

The issues of children and youth with mental illness are not simply after-thoughts in the minds of scientists and policy makers as they once might have been but are, instead, increasingly central to policy and science on mental illness in general. Disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism play a key role in the advancement of the genetics and nosology of psychiatric disorders of all kinds in ways that could scarcely have been imagined a decade ago. These successes reflect the long-standing tradition of collaborative and multidisciplinary research and practice that characterizes child and adolescent psychiatry.

METHODS A total of 164 NAFLD patients who had IGT in the first 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and underwent a repeated OGTT five years later were enrolled. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors predicting the regression from IGT to NGR. RESULTS Out of the 164 patients, 29 regressed from IGT to NGR within five years after the first OGTT. The multivariate analysis by logistic regression showed that regression from IGT to NGR occurred when the patient was young (risk ratio for ten years: 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.72; p=0.003), had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of <100 mg/dL (risk ratio: 6.53; 95%CI 1.88-21.73; p=0.003), had a 2-hr post-load plasma glucose (PG) level of <160 mg/dL (risk ratio: 4.86; 95%CI 1.08-22.72; p=0.040), a body mass index (BMI) decrease of ≥1.5 (risk ratio: 5.20; 95% CI 1.41-19.24; p=0.014), physical activity of ≥2 Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) h/day (risk ratio: 5.57; 95%CI 1.68-18.44; p=0.005), and showed disappearance of the fatty liver by ultrasonography at five years (risk ratio: 9.92; 95%CI 2.87-34.34; p<0.001).

The CCM calculation for the future atmosphere was performed for the period of 1975–2100 under a future scenario of time-varying halogens, greenhouse gases, and sea surface temperatures for chemistry-climate model validation (CCMVal-REF2 scenario). A sensitivity test of a no-climate-change run for the future atmosphere was also performed, in which the concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O were fixed at those for 1975, and the sea surface temperature was fixed at that for the 1970–1979 mean, while the halogen concentrations were changed following the REF2 scenario. A comparison of the return time to 1980 values in these two runs was made. The return times of the halogen concentrations and column ozone in the extratropics for the REF2 run are earlier than those for the no-climate-change run, influenced by an enhancement of the meridional circulation and stratospheric cooling in the atmosphere. In the tropics, the column ozone of the REF2 run shows a second decrease after 2050, influenced by a stronger upward motion in the future atmosphere than in the present atmosphere. Trends in the zonal mean ozone concentration, zonal mean temperature, zonal mean zonal wind, Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux, EP flux divergence, vertical component of the residual mean meridional circulation, and chemical forcing to the ozone concentration are examined in the periods of 2000–2050 and 2051–2100. These trends in the dynamical and chemical factors explain the earlier return times of halogens and ozone in the extratropics of the REF2 run than in the no-climate-change run. In the no-climate-change run, a better correlation between the return time of column ozone to the 1980 level and that of the lower stratospheric halogen concentration is calculated for the Southern Hemisphere corresponding to the facts that the ozone concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere lower stratosphere are more controlled by chlorine and bromine chemistries than those in the Northern Hemisphere.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We present a novel nonparametric approach for identification of nonlinear systems. Exploiting the framework of Gaussian regression, the unknown nonlinear system is seen as a realization from a Gaussian random field. Its covariance encodes the idea of “fading” memory in the predictor and consists of a mixture of Gaussian kernels parametrized by few hyperparameters describing the interactions among past inputs and outputs. The kernel structure and the unknown hyperparameters are estimated maximizing their marginal likelihood so that the user is not required to define any part of the algorithmic architecture, e.g., the regressors and the model order. Once the kernel is estimated, the nonlinear model is obtained solving a Tikhonov-type variational problem. The Hilbert space the estimator belongs to is characterized. Benchmarks problems taken from the literature show the effectiveness of the new approach, also comparing its performance with a recently proposed algorithm based on direct weight optimization and with parametric approaches with model order estimated by AIC or BIC.',\n",

The key idea is to use a likelihood-based approach to calculate the probability distribution function (PDF) of the variable described by sparse data and an entropy-based transformation method to obtain the PDF of variable described by expert-based information.

The holomycin chromophore is also present in thioluthin, aureothricin, the xenorhabdins and the complex thiomarinols. Streptomyces clavuligerus ATCC 27064 contains the holomycin gene cluster (hlm). This antibiotic is formed by a cysteine-activating non-ribosomal peptide synthetase followed by four reduction steps by a set of four different flavoproteins; the intermediate is cyclized by a thiol oxidase and modified by acylation. Holomycin is a broad spectrum antibiotic, reported as antitumoral, acting in vivo on RNA synthesis. It is modified intracellularly by the producer strains by methylation and formation of heterodimers as a way of self-protection.

Because the phosphor is excited by the light that propagates in the tissue, and the excitation light is cut by optical filters, the light that propagates in the tissue is selectively detected. The non-contact syst em was extended to create a scanning sy stem that can flexibly change source positions with a galvano scanner. The optical scanning system was used for non-contact measurement of the human forearm muscle, and the dependence of optical-density change ( u OD ) caused by the upper-arm occlusion and release on source-detector distance wa s observed. The obtained u OD demonstrates the effectiveness of using this system for multi-distance human-forearm measurement. Furthermore, a human forehead was measured with the system. To extract a deep-layer signal, a surface-layer subtraction method with short-distance regression was applied to measured data. On the basis of the correlation with a simultaneously measured laser-Doppler flowmetry signal, it was confirmed that the deep-layer signal was successfu lly extracted. The extraction result demonstrat es that the optical scanning system can be used as a multi-distance NIRS system for meas uring the human brain act ivity at the forehead.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     The assessment of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs can provide insights into the evolution of the pore structure systems around the first coalification jump (FCJ). The southern Junggar Basin, a typical low-rank coal-bearing basin in northwestern China, has been of interest to scientists and policy-makers due to its abundance of CBM resources and favourable conditions for CBM enrichment. A total of 28 coal samples from the Middle Jurassic Xishanyao Formation collected from 11 sampling sites in the central segment of the southern Junggar Basin were analyzed in this study. These samples were quantitatively characterized and comprehensively evaluated using macroscopic to nanometer-scale methods including macroscopic coal description, proximate analysis, vitrinite reflectance measurements, maceral analysis, low pressure nitrogen adsorption (LPNA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The results show that the Xishanyao low-rank coals are characterized by low moisture contents, low or low-medium ash yields (eastern and western parts), high volatile matter contents, moderate vitrinite contents, and high inertinite contents. The physical property of the Xishanyao coals generally displays heterogeneity, with the specific surface area, the total pore volume, the air permeability and the transverse relaxation time (T2) ranging from 0.116 to 15.983\\xa0m2/g, 0.461\\xa0×\\xa010−3 to 13.37\\xa0×\\xa010−3\\xa0cm3/g, 0.001 to 151.66 mD (0.987\\xa0×\\xa010−6 to 0.149\\xa0μm2) and 1.44–174.22\\xa0ms, respectively. A new parameter, namely micropore volume proportion per unit nano-meter, is proposed. Micropore and transition pore volume per nm, specific surface area, total pore volume, DN1 and DN2 (LPNA fractal dimension) all first increase, then decrease and finally increase with rising coal rank, while the maximum and minimum values of the maximum vitrinite reflectance (Ro, max) occur at 0.58–0.59% and 0.65–0.66%. The boundary of Ro, max corresponding to the FCJ can be further defined from 0.5-0.6% to 0.58–0.59% based on the evolution of adsorption pore structures. Thus, pore structure parameters related to adsorption capacity are controlled predominantly by coal rank. In addition, tectonic deformation has a strong impact on seepage pore structure but only a slight impact on that of adsorption pore, which leads to an ambiguous correlation or a complex trend between mesopore, macropore content, DMIP (fractal dimension of MIP) and coal rank around the FCJ. This study reveals the complex variation of pore structure evolution of low-rank coals and the significant influence of the FCJ on physical properties of coalbed methane reservoirs.',\n",

Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated after 48 hours of transwell coculture of TCs and autologous μFAT in the presence or absence of IL-1β. Gene expression of scleraxis, collagen type I and type III, metalloproteinases-1 and -3, and cyclooxygenase-2 was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. The content of VEGF, IL-1Ra, TNFα, and IL-6 was evaluated by ELISA. Results. IL-1β-treated TCs showed augmented collagen type III, metalloproteases, and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. μFAT was able to reduce the expression of collagen type III and metalloproteases-1 in a significant manner, and at the same time, it enhanced the production of VEGF, IL-1Ra, and IL-6. Conclusions. In this in vitro model of tendon cell inflammation, the paracrine action of μFAT, exerted by anti-inflammatory molecules and growth factors, was able to inhibit the expression of fibrosis and catabolic markers.

The studied rocks are composed of basaltic andesitic, andesitic, trachyandesitic, and minor trachydacitic lavas associated with their pyroclastics. These rocks contain plagioclase (An2-44), hornblende (Mg#= 0.78-0.98), clinopyroxene (Wo43-46 En41-43 Fs10-15), biotite, quartz, and minor sanidine phenocrysts. K-Ar ages on hornblendes ages range from 43.99 (±2.59) to 33.45 (±2.32) Ma, within the Middle to Late Eocene. The volcanic rocks show calc-alkaline affinities and have medium to high K contents. They are enriched in large ion lithophile (LILE) and light rare earth elements (LREE), with pronounced depletion of high field strength elements (HFSE). The chondrite-normalized REE patterns (Lacn/Lucn= 4.0-9.8) show low to medium enrichment, indicating similar sources for the rock suite. Initial 87Sr/86Sr values vary between 0.70457 and 0.70511 and initial 143Nd/144Nd values between 0.51264 and 0.51278. The main solidification processes involved in the evolution of the volcanics consist of fractional crystallization with minor amounts of crustal contamination ± magma mixing. All evidence supports the conclusion that the parental magma(s) of the rocks probably derived from an enriched upper mantle, previously modified by subduction- induced metasomatism in a post-collisional geodynamic setting.',\n",

The 75,512 Caucasian, Japanese American, and Native Hawaiian participants aged 45-75 y at baseline completed a FFQ. After 14 y of follow-up, 8587 incident diabetes cases were identified through self-reports and health plans. We applied Cox regression stratified for age at cohort entry and adjusted for ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, education, and total energy with further stratifications by sex and ethnicity. When comparing extreme quintiles, total fiber intake was associated with reduced diabetes risk among all men [hazard ratio (HR): 0.75; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.84; P-trend < 0.001) and women (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.06; P-trend = 0.05). High intake of grain fiber reduced diabetes risk significantly by 10% in men and women. High vegetable fiber intake lowered risk by 22% in all men but not women. Mg intake reduced risk (HR = 0.77 and 0.84 for men and women, respectively) and, due to its strong correlation with fiber (r = 0.83; P < 0.001), may explain the protective effect of fiber. The top GL quintile was associated with a significantly elevated diabetes incidence in Caucasian men and in all women except Japanese Americans. Overall, several associations were more pronounced in Caucasians than in the other groups. These findings suggest that protection against diabetes can be achieved through food choices after taking into account body weight, but, due to differences in commonly consumed foods, risk estimates may differ by ethnic group.',\n",

In this study, a process-based evapotranspiration (ET) model in conjunction with the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI dataset was used to characterize the spatial-temporal pattern of evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2016 over the Gan River basin (GRB), the largest sub-basin of the Poyang Lake catchment, China. The results showed that the actual annual ET (ETa) weakly increased with an annual trend of 0.88 mm year−2 from 1982 to 2016 over the GRB, along with a slight decline in annual potential ET (ETp). On an ecosystem scale; however, only the evergreen broadleaved forest and cropland presented a positive ETa trend, while the rest of the ecosystems demonstrated negative trends of ETa. Both correlation analysis and sensitivity analysis revealed a close relationship between ETa inter-annual variability and energy availability. Attribution analysis illustrated that contributions of climate change and vegetation greening on the ETa trend were −0.48 mm year−2 and 1.36 mm year−2, respectively. Climate change had a negative impact on the ETa trend over the GRB. However, the negative effects have been offset by the positive effects of vegetation greening, which mainly resulted from the large-scale revegetation in forestland and agricultural practices in cropland. It is concluded that large-scale afforestation and agricultural management were the main drivers of the long-term evolution of water consumption over the GRB. This study can improve our understanding of the interactive effects of climate change and human activities on the long-term evolution of water cycles.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"We have studied experimentally the states formed in artificial square ice nanomagnet systems following demagnetisation in a rotating in-plane applied magnetic field that reduces to zero in a manner that is linear in time. The final states are found to be controlled via the system's lattice constant, which determines the strength of the magnetostatic interactions between the elements, as well as the field ramping rate. We understand these effects as a requirement that the system undergoes a sufficiently large number of active rotations within the critical field window in which elements may be reversed, such that the interactions are allowed to locally exert their influence if the ground state is to be approached. On the other hand, if quenched disorder is too strong when compared to the interaction strength, any close approach to the ground state is impossible. These results show that it is not necessary for there to be any ac component to the field amplitude that is applied to the system during demagnetisation, which is the method almost exclusively employed in field protocols reported to date. Furthermore, by optimising the parameters of our linear demagnetisation protocol, the largest field-generated ground state domains yet reported are found.\",\n",

Although such algorithms have long been available, they usually require a large number of model runs and are therefore computationally expensive for large, complex dynamic models. In this paper, a multiobjective adaptive surrogate modeling-based optimization (MO-ASMO) algorithm is introduced that aims to reduce computational cost while maintaining optimization effectiveness. Geophysical dynamic models usually have a prior parameterization scheme derived from the physical processes involved, and our goal is to improve all of the objectives by parameter calibration. In this study, we developed a method for directing the search processes toward the region that can improve all of the objectives simultaneously. We tested the MO-ASMO algorithm against NSGA-II and SUMO with 13 test functions and a land surface model - the Common Land Model (CoLM).

However, terpenes are sensitive to oxidation leading to quality loss during beer aging. Herein, the reactivity of terpenes towards 1-hydroxyethyl radical has been determined employing a competitive kinetic approach using the spin-trap α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)- N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN). The apparent rate constant (kapp) for the reaction of terpenes with 1-hydroxyethyl radical ranges from (3.9 ± 0.2) × 105 to (1.5 ± 0.2) × 107 L mol−1 s−1 for β-pinene and terpinolene, respectively. The reaction involves hydrogen atom transfer from the terpene to 1-hydroxyethyl radical rather than electron-transfer and the rate constant is shown to be dependent on the number of allylic and benzylic hydrogen atoms and on the value of the bond dissociation enthalpy for the weakest C−H bond. The results provide a better understanding on the mechanism behind terpene decomposition in beer brewing and aging process and may further contibute to improve the oxidative stability of the herb-flavored beverages.',\n",

The transitions studied populate intermediate states of importance for the (neutrinoless) {beta}{beta} decay of {sup 150}Nd to {sup 150}Sm. Monopole and dipole contributions to the measured excitation-energy spectra were extracted by using multipole decomposition analyses.

The present results thus provide useful information on the neutrino responses for evaluating the 0{nu}{beta}{beta} and 2{nu}{beta}{beta} matrix elements.

As Texas was reported to be among the lowest in the US for opioid use and misuse, further examination of this state is warranted. Materials and Methods This study was conducted to quantify prescription opioid use in Texas. Data was obtained from the publicly available US Drug Enforcement Administration's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) which monitors controlled substances transactions from manufacture to commercial distribution. Data for 2006-2017 from Texas for ten prescription opioids including eight primarily used to relieve pain (codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone) and two (buprenorphine and methadone) for the treatment of an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) were examined. Results The change in morphine mg equivalent (MME) of all opioids (+23.3%) was only slightly greater than the state's population gains (21.1%). Opioids used to treat an OUD showed pronounced gains (+90.8%) which were four-fold faster than population growth. Analysis of individual agents revealed pronounced elevations in codeine (+387.5%), hydromorphone (+106.7%), and oxycodone (+43.6%) and a reduction in meperidine (-80.3%) in 2017 relative to 2006. Methadone in 2017 accounted for a greater portion (39.5%) of the total MME than hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and meperidine, combined. There were differences between urban and rural areas in the changes in hydrocodone and buprenorphine. Conclusions Collectively, these findings indicate that continued vigilance is needed in Texas to appropriately treat pain and an OUD while minimizing the potential for prescription opioid diversion and misuse. Texas may lead the US in a return to pre-opioid epidemic prescription levels.\",\n",

The influence of environmental conditions on the formation of these parameters in different wheat genotypes during grain ripening was demonstrated. It was demonstrated that the grain softness in comparison with the grain hardness and amylopectin form led to a considerable decrease in water absorption capacity (Absorption) of the grain. The environment affects variation of this trait in amylose genotypes, but does not affect absorption in amylopectin forms. Differences in grain hardness affected the gluten parameter, but showed no response to the environmental influence. Genotypes differing in Wx genes had no hereditary effect on this parameter. The influence of environment factors on the formation of this parameter was revealed. In the years favorable for the wheat grain ripening, the values of viscosity and retrogradation indices were considerably lower in amylopectin forms compared to amylose ones. In the conditions of increased humidity during this period, the differences between these groups of genotypes are smoothed out, and very low viscosity and retrogradation index values are observed. Unlike environmental factors, the differences in grain hardness had no effect on these grain quality parameters. The amylase index in amylopectin forms was stable over the years and did not vary in this group of genotypes and also did not differ from that in amylose genotypes. The response of this index to environmental conditions in the groups of amylose-type cultivars was observed. In the years with the weather conditions favorable for wheat ripening, the viscosity index can be used for identification of amylopectin genotypes.',\n",

Recognizing their high proportion in drugs and rich pharmacological potential, these invaluable structural motifs have garnered significant interest, thus enabling the development of efficient catalytic methodologies providing access to architecturally complex and diverse molecules with high atom-economy and low cost. These chemical processes not only allow the formation of diverse heterocycles but also utilize a range of flexible and easily accessible building units in a single operation to discover diversity-oriented synthetic approaches. Alkynoates are significantly important, diverse and powerful building blocks in organic chemistry due to their unique and inherent properties such as the electronic bias on carbon–carbon triple bonds posed by electron-withdrawing groups or the metallic coordination site provided by carbonyl groups. The present review highlights the comprehensive picture of the utility of alkynoates (2007–2019) for the synthesis of various heterocycles (>\\u200950 types) using transition-metal catalysts (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Ag, Au, Pt, Cu, Mn, Fe) in various forms. The valuable function of versatile alkynoates (bearing multifunctional groups) as simple and useful starting materials is explored, thus cyclizing with an array of coupling partners to deliver a broad range of oxygen-, nitrogen-, sulfur-containing heterocycles alongside fused-, and spiro-heterocyclic compounds. In addition, these examples will also focus the scope and reaction limitations, as well as mechanistic investigations into the synthesis of these heterocycles. The biological significance will also be discussed, citing relevant examples of drug molecules highlighting each class of heterocycles. This review summarizes the recent developments in the synthetic methods for the synthesis of various heterocycles using alkynoates as readily available starting materials under transition-metal catalysis.',\n",

METHODS All incident patients undergoing insertion of a tunneled haemodialysis catheter were screened and included except those suffering infection or using oral anticoagulation. Study participants were randomized into two arms according to the solution applied as catheter lock: receiving either trisodium citrate (Citra-LockTM 4%) only or rt-PA (Actilyse® 1\\u2009mg/ml) on the middle session each week with citrate used on the first and third sessions. The incidence of CR-BSI (confirmed by positive blood culture), catheter non-function (complete obstruction), and malfunction (blood flow <\\u2009250\\u2009ml/min) was recorded. Statistical significance was tested with ANOVA, post hoc analysis was performed by means of multiple linear regression. RESULTS Totally, 18 patients were included and followed during 655 haemodialysis sessions. No episode of CR-BSI was detected while 6 catheter non-functions (0.9% sessions) and 101 malfunctions (15.4% sessions) were recorded. The incidence of both events was equal between the study arms: 4 non-functions and 55 malfunctions in the rt-PA arm and 2 non-functions and 46 malfunctions in the citrate arm (p\\u2009=\\u20090.47 and p\\u2009=\\u20090.24, respectively). Additionally, the mean blood flow achieved did not differ significantly between the arms: 326\\u2009±\\u20091,8 and 326\\u2009±\\u20091,9\\u2009ml/min (p\\u2009=\\u20090.95) in rt-PA and citrate arms, respectively. Post hoc analysis identified time elapsed since previous session (β\\u2009=\\u20090.12, p\\u2009=\\u20090.005) and malfunction on previous session (β\\u2009=\\u20090.25, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) as significant factors affecting the occurrence of malfunction. By contrast, the study arm, rt-PA application on previous session, and catheter vintage did not enter the model. CONCLUSION Substitution of citrate with rt-PA for catheter lock does not reduce the incidence of catheter malfunction neither does it affect the blood flow achieved during haemodialysis. Catheter patency is related rather to the time interval between sessions and to previous malfunction (thus probably reflecting undefined individual factors).

Animals with high fat (n\\xa0=\\xa09; Model-group) and normal diet (n\\xa0=\\xa04; Control-group) were sacrificed after 16 weeks. 3D fluid-structure interaction analysis was performed to quantify WSS and VSS simultaneously.       Results   Twenty plaques were found in Model-group and 3 in Control-group. In Model-group, 8 plaques located proximally to the first constriction (Region-1, close to the heart) and 7 distally to the second (Region-2, close to the head) and 5 plaques were found on the contralateral side of 3 rabbits. Plaques at Region-1 tended to be bigger than those at Region-2 and the macrophage density at these locations was comparable. Minimum time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) in Region-1 was significantly higher than that in Region-2, and both maximum oscillatory shear index (OSI) and particle relative residence time (RRT) were significantly lower. Peak and mean VSS in Region-1 were significantly higher than those in Region-2.

Moreover, three secondary metabolites of the essential oil, i.e. 2-decanone, 2-nonanone and 2-undecanone, showed EC50 values of 0.07 ± 0.06, 0.25 ± 0.29 and 0.88 ± 0.73 mg/ml at 24 h, respectively. The present study indicated that the R. chalepensis methanol extract, the essential oil and its metabolites 2-decanone, 2-nonanone and 2-undecanone showed promising anthelmintic activity on gastrointestinal nematodes.',\n",

Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. 2015 September;45(3):184-189.) Background: Since 2009, the United Kingdom diving incident data show an increasing number of fatalities in the over50s age group. Previous studies also suggest some divers take cardiac medications. Since 2001, diving medicals have not been mandatory for UK sport divers. Instead, an annual medical self-certifi cation form, submitted to their club/school or training establishment, is required. We documented in a survey of UK sport divers the prevalence of cardiac events and medications and the frequency of medical certifi cations. Methods: An anonymous on-line questionnaire was publicised. Measures included diver and diving demographics, prescribed medications, diagnosed hypertension, cardiac issues, events and procedures, other health issues, year of last diving medical, diagnosed persistent foramen ovale (PFO), smoking and alcohol habits, exercise and body mass index. Results: Of 672 completed surveys, hypertension was reported by 119 (18%) with 25 of these (21%) having not had a diving medical. Myocardial infarction 6 (1%), coronary artery bypass grafting 3 (< 1%), atrial fi brillation 19 (3%) and angina 12 (2%) were also reported. PFOs were reported by 28 (4%), with 20 of these opting for a closure procedure. From 83 treated incidences of decompression illness (DCI), 19 divers reported that a PFO was diagnosed. Conclusions: Divers inevitably develop health problems. Some continue to dive with cardiac issues, failing to seek specialised diving advice or fully understand the role of the diving medical. Physicians without appropriate training in diving medicine may inform a diver they are safe to continue diving with their condition without appreciating the potential risks. The current procedure for medical screening for fi tness to dive may not be adequate for all divers.',\n",

The method, so-called steady-state pre-rRNA-analysis, represents a novel culture-independent approach to study bacteria. This study employed this technique to examine the in situ growth activities of oral bacteria in periodontitis before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Sub-gingival paper-point samples were taken at initial and re-evaluation appointments.

The results indicate significantly reduced growth activity of P. gingivalis, but not F. alocis, after therapy. The P:G ratios of P. gingivalis and F. alocis were compared and a low-strength, but statistically significant inter-species correlation was detected.

Deficit irrigation was commonly investigated in dry areas as a precious and sustainable production approach. Using the CropSyst model to simulate the effects of different deficit irrigation treatments could help draw conclusions and save time, effort, and money. Therefore, the aims of this research were (i) to calibrate and validate the CropSyst model for wheat under different sustained and phenological stage-based deficit irrigation treatments, (ii) to simulate the impacts of the latter treatments on limiting wheat yield reduction. Two field experiments were conducted in Nubaria (Egypt), representing an arid environment. They included seven irrigation treatments: (1) 100%, (2) 75%, or (3) 50% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) during the whole crop cycle; (4) 50% ETc at tillering only, or (5) at booting only, or (6) at grain filling only, or (7) at both tillering and grain filling, with the replenishment of 100% ETc to the treatments (4) to (7) in the remaining phenological stages. The results revealed that phenological stage-based deficit irrigation of wheat resulted in lower yield reduction compared to sustained deficit irrigation treatments, with a 6% yield reduction when 50% ETc was applied at the booting stage. Wheat yield loss was reduced to 4 or 6% when 95 or 90% of ETc were applied, respectively. The CropSyst model accurately simulated wheat grain and total dry matter under deficit irrigation with low RMSE value. In conclusion, the CropSyst model can be reliably used for evaluating the strategy of planned deficit irrigation management in terms of wheat production under the arid environment.',\n",

We specified the five plant types for evaluating the impacts of biogas utilization and the co-location of ethanol production at existing cassava starch factories and assessed the life-cycle GHG emissions of these plant types.   The results showed that the amount of GHG emission reduction in cassava ethanol production depended on the plant type. Substantial GHG savings are achieved by ethanol plants that use biogas produced during wastewater treatment as fuel. Using biogas for steam generation is more effective in reducing GHG emissions than using it for electricity generation. Plants co-located with starch factories have advantages in relation to GHG emissions when compared with stand-alone plants. However, the impact of co-location is limited because cassava starch factories are not energetically self-sufficient. Improvement analysis suggested that boiler efficiency and the energy source for steam generation are key factors for reducing GHG emissions.',\n",

We hypothesized that supplementation of GTP in drinking water would benefit body composition, enhance bone quality, and suppress obesity-related endocrines in HF diet-induced obese female rats and that such changes are related to an elevation of antioxidant capacity and a reduction of proinflammatory cytokine production. After 8 months, compared with the LF diet, the HF diet increased percentage of fat mass and serum insulin-like growth factor I and leptin levels; reduced percentage of fat-free mass, bone strength, and GPX protein expression; but had no effect on bone mineral density and serum adiponectin levels in the rats. Green tea polyphenol supplementation increased percentage of fat-free mass, bone mineral density and strength, and GPX protein expression and decreased percentage of fat mass, serum insulin-like growth factor I, leptin, adiponectin, and proinflammatory cytokines in the obese rats.

Methods   (a) The retrospective study included inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with azathioprine (AZA)/6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity and 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) levels were detected at stable medication points. (b) The prospective study was performed in active disease patients: 4 weeks of AZA 50 mg/day followed by concomitant 5-ASA 3 g/day for another 4 weeks. 6-TGN was analyzed at weeks 4 and 8.   Results   (a) Of the 139 retrospective study patients, 45 were on AZA/6-MP+5-ASA and 94 on AZA/6-MP alone. The myelotoxicity rates were 47 and 16%, respectively. Multivariates regression analysis indicated that the administration of concomitant 5-ASA was the only risk factor associated with myelotoxicity (odds ratio=3.45, 95% confidence interval 1.31-9.04, P=0.01). (b) Thiopurine methyltransferase activity was not significantly different between patients on AZA/6-MP+5-ASA and patients on AZA/6-MP alone (P=0.78). (c) 6-TGN levels were significantly higher in samples on AZA/6-MP+5-ASA than those on AZA/6-MP (P=0.003) alone. (d) Sixteen patients completed the prospective study.

Conclusion   The risk of thiopurine-induced myelotoxicity markedly increases in patients treated with combined 5-ASA and 2 mg/kg/day AZA therapy, which may be correlated to the increase in 6-TGN. 50 mg daily AZA when concomitant 5-ASA might help maintain an effective 6-TGN level without increasing the risk of myelotoxicity.\",\n",

METHODS All 1,197 renal allograft recipients who were transplanted at a single center between 1991 and 2001 were included. All posttransplant renal allograft indication biopsies performed in this cohort during follow-up (mean, 14.5±2.80 years after transplantation) were rescored according to the current histological criteria and associated with death-censored graft outcome. RESULTS In this cohort, 1,365 allograft indication biopsies were performed. Specific diagnoses were present in 69.4% of graft biopsies before graft loss, but 30.6% of grafts did not have specific diagnoses in the last biopsy before graft loss. Only 14.6% of the patients did never have any specific disease diagnosed before graft loss. Extensive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy without a clear cause was identified as the single cause of graft loss in only 6.9% of the cases. Acute T-cell-mediated rejection and changes suggestive of acute antibody-mediated rejection, diagnosed after the first year posttransplant, associated independently with graft survival. Transplant glomerulopathy increased over time after transplantation and represented a major risk for graft loss, as well as de novo or recurrent glomerular pathologies and polyomavirus nephropathy. Chronic histological injury associated with graft outcome, independent of specific diagnoses. CONCLUSION Renal allograft loss is multifactorial. Chronic histological damage and specific diseases had additive and independent impact on graft outcome. Chronic damage should be taken into account in prognostication of renal allograft outcome and could be implemented in treatment algorithms for specific diseases of kidney allografts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The purpose of this study is to analyze the shadow banking issues related to financial collaterals in the form of book-entry securities, as defined in EU under the Financial Collateral Directive (Directive 2002/47/EC, as in force), the so-called ‘FCD’. It examines different legal approaches related to the activities of securities reuse or re-hypothecation that financial intermediaries, mainly as collateral takers, conduct in modern markets. Despite its positive aspects, it is beyond any doubt that re-hypothecation poses risks to the markets. The collapse of too large both in number and size entities in recent times that negatively affected investors properties in securities pointed out that the ‘too big to fail’ myth is not rather real. To this end, further measures have to be taken in addressing these risks. The study points out the following as areas on which EU regulation should focus in this respect: (a) Collaterals reuse and re-hypothecation should not be regarded as a pure contractual choice but as a specific service or activity that should be subject to further EU regulation and supervision for its provision by the intermediaries. In achieving this goal, it would be appropriate for a reform of the custody activities to be accelerated for the purposes of distinguishing from a prudential regulatory perspective any ‘non-banking type of safekeeping services’, that is, the custody activities that by definition do not include any securities reuse, from the ‘banking type of safekeeping services’, that is, the custody activities that as banking-like credit intermediation activities may include such a reuse. (b) There should be a clear definition of ‘who owns what’ that should operate as a uniform substantive law rule. This definition should cover the need of proprietary aspects and rights in book-entry securities to be recognized on an EU level regardless of the legal nature of the chains of the securities holding systems and intermediaries involved, that is, regardless of the definition of ‘who holds what’. The ‘who owns what’ definition would be appropriate to be based not on the existing ‘securities account’ approach, as adopted by FCD, which in concept reflects the ‘PRIMA’ (‘Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach’) principles, but on an approach able to accommodate the ownership and the other proprietary aspects in book-entry securities more accurately from a legal perspective. This approach should take seriously into account the concepts of the ‘law under which the securities are constituted’ as an aspect of the lex societatis rule. In this regard and for the purposes of establishing proprietary rights in book-entry securities, the actual owners (shareholders) should be registered as such in the official registrars of the country of the securities constitution. (c) Furthermore and in terms of addressing the issues of cross-border securities holdings, there should be a clear conflict of laws rule in determining the applicable law for all the proprietary aspects in such securities. This rule should be based on the above ‘who owns what’ substantive law definition. In this regard, the applicable law that should define the proprietary rights in securities should be the law under which the securities are constituted. Therefore, any investor registered, for example as a shareholder, under the registry system applicable in accordance with the law under which the relevant securities are constituted, shall be considered as the owner of the securities regardless of the systems and chains of intermediaries to which the investor entrusted their property in such securities to be held. The study considers all these parameters as of extreme importance in addressing the ‘shadow banking’ issues in the securities and collaterals sector and, to this regard, in achieving a real protection for the markets and the investors in EU.',\n",

Monitoring physiological signal while driving can   provide the possibility to detect the fatigue and give the necessary warning. In this paper, fifty subjects   participated in driving simulations experiment with their recorded EEG signals to induce two kinds of fatigue   states: Alert and drowsy. Two nonlinear methods, approximate Entropy (AE) and Sample Entropy (SE),   were used to characterize irregularity and complexity of EEG data. Subsequently Support Vector Machine   (SVM) was applied to classify these two fatigue states. The experimental result shows that two complexity   parameters are significantly decreased as the fatigue level increases. The result indicates that both of two   nonlinear indicators can be used to characterize driver fatigue level.

       "  'abstract': 'Although nicotine accounts for a great deal of the neurodevelopmental damage associated with maternal smoking or second-hand exposure, tobacco smoke contains thousands of potentially neurotoxic compounds. We used PC12 cells, a standard in vitro model of neurodifferentiation, to compare tobacco smoke extract (TSE) to nicotine, matching TSE exposure (with its inherent nicotine content) to parallel concentrations of nicotine, or to benzo[a]pyrene, a tobacco combustion product. TSE promoted the transition from cell replication to differentiation, resulting in fewer, but larger cells with greater neurite extension. TSE also biased differentiation into the dopaminergic versus the cholinergic phenotype, evidenced by an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity but not choline acetyltransferase. Nicotine likewise promoted differentiation at the expense of cell numbers, but its effect on growth and neurite extension was smaller than that of TSE; furthermore, nicotine did not promote the dopaminergic phenotype. Benzo[a]pyrene had effects opposite to those of TSE, retarding neurodifferentiation, which resulted in higher cell numbers, smaller cells, reduced neurite information, and impaired emergence of both dopaminergic and cholinergic phenotypes. Our studies show that the complex mixture of compounds in tobacco smoke exerts direct effects on neural cell replication and differentiation that resemble those of nicotine in some ways but not others, and most importantly, that are greater in magnitude than can be accounted for from just the nicotine content of TSE. Thus, fetal tobacco smoke exposure, including lower levels associated with second-hand smoke, could be more injurious than would be anticipated from measured levels of nicotine or its metabolites.',\n",

Herein, the realization of two extreme superhydrophobic states on 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H–perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane-modified TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) is described by changing the structural characteristics of nanotubes while keeping the surface chemical composition constant. The water adhesive force is regulated in a wide range from ≈4.4 to ≈89.6 μN by the nanotubular diameter, length, density, and surface roughness. The cooperation effect between the negative pressures induced by the volume change of sealed air-pockets and the van der Waals' attraction at solid–liquid interface contributes to the water adhesion. The superhydrophobic TiO2 NTAs with a high adhesive force is used as a “mechanical hand” to transfer water microdroplets without any loss, and the one with extremely low adhesive force is utilized as a self-cleaning and anti-icing surface.\",\n",

A series of samples with highly hydrophilic, hydrophilic, hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces were prepared. The advancing and receding contact angles of these samples with highly hydrophilic, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic surfaces through the new methods was comparable to the result tested by the traditional sessile drop method. It is proved that this method overcomes the limitation of the traditional captive bubble method and the modified captive bubble method allows a smaller error from the test.

To achieve the high-efficiency and high-precision machining of such titanium alloy parts, in this study, we propose the electrical discharge machining (EDM) technology based on distributed group electrodes and the tool ball positioning method. Orthogonal process experiments were designed considering process parameters including the peak current, pulse width, duty cycle, and lifting cycle. A comprehensive and intuitive balance analysis method was used to determine the material removal rate, relative electrode loss, and surface roughness, as well as the optimal combination of the process parameters. We constructed the distributed group graphite electrodes and the positioning system of the tool ball, which significantly reduced the machining difficulty of traditional group electrodes and the replacement times of electrodes during machining, and improved the positioning accuracy of electrodes. The results showed that an optimal combination of the parameters could effectively improve the machining efficiency and reduce the electrode loss while ensuring the surface quality requirements. The above-mentioned methods can improve the machining efficiency of the titanium alloy parts with a large inclined angle and thin-walled group holes by more than 1.5 times and significantly reduced the machining accuracy error of repeated positioning.',\n",

A modified derivatisation-based methodology was applied for the first time to detect estrogen in free and conjugated forms including some isomers simultaneously using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSn). Derivatisation reaction with previously used 1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazole-5-sulphonyl chloride allowed significant increase of mass spectrometric signal of analytes and also provided distinctive fragmentation for their confirmation even in complicated matrix. Then satisfactory recovery (>75%) for the majority of analytes was achieved following optimisation of solid phase extraction (SPE) factors. The linearity was validated over a wide concentration with the correlation coefficient around 0.995. The repeatability of this methodology was also confirmed via the intra-day and inter-day precision and was less than 11.73%. Validation of method quantification limits (MQLs) for all chosen estrogens was conducted using 1000 mL surface water, ranging from 7.0 to 132.3 pg L−1. The established methodology was applied to profile presence of targeted estrogens in natural surface water samples. Out of the ten compounds of interest, three free estrogens (E1, E2, E3) and two sulphate estrogens (E1-3S and E2-3S) were found over their MQLs, being in the range of 0.05–0.32 ng L−1.',\n",

After dilute acid hydrolysis, DP hydrolysate (DPH) and DP solid fraction (DPSF) hydrolysis residues were generated. Yeast lipid was produced from undetoxified DPH by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa KKUSY14. DPSF was subjected to a one-step sulfonation process to prepare a solid catalyst (DPSF-SO3H) and was characterized using FTIR, XRD, and FE-SEM analysis. DPSF-SO3H catalyst exhibited good catalytic activity for yeast-based biodiesel (FAME) production from wet cell of KKUSY14 grown in DPH by direct transesterification. FAME yields of 81.57% and 78.73% were reached, respectively, for microwave and conventional heating. The fuel properties of FAME were in accordance with the ASTM and EN standards. Based on the higher heating value of FAME produced, an energy output of about 32.44–34.90\\xa0MJ/kg was estimated. The proposed bio-refinery concept led to the production of 101.2\\xa0kg yeast biomass, 16.0\\xa0kg yeast lipid, 717\\xa0kg DPSF-SO3H catalyst, 79.7–82.6\\xa0kg FAME, and 70.4\\xa0kg yeast residues from 1000\\xa0kg of DP waste.

The method is started by combining a few grams of the melted butter or oil samples with ethanol. The mixture is vortexed and placed into a water-bath adjusted at 50 ⁰C. After a few minutes, the mixture is allowed to cool at room temperature. In this step, the butter or oil is become stiff and ethanol is collected on top of the sample. The separated ethanol phase is collected and mixed with deionized water to obtain a homogenous solution. After that, a few microliters of ethyl methyl ammonium chloride: pivalic acid deep eutectic solvent is added into the solution and the mixture was pulled into a glass test tube and pushed back to the tube for five times. After centrifugation, whole of the collected phase at the bottom of tube was withdrawn and transferred into a microtube and contacted with sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is withdrawn and released to the tube 2 times to remove the extracted fatty acids. The validation data verified that high enrichment factors (385-450) and extraction recoveries (77-90%), low limits of quantification (2.6-5.2 ng g-1) and detection (0.73-1.5 ng g-1), and satisfactory relative standard deviations (≤ 9.3%) can be obtained with this method.

In order to achieve this, insights in the behaviour of the water fluxes and the interaction between groundwater and surface 5 water is of utmost importance. This paper discusses the applicability and constraints of using hydrochemical and isotope tracers in identifying the runo contributing sources at di erent scales in a semi-arid catchment in Tanzania. The hydrograph separation techniques shows that at the smallest scale (0.3km 2 ), for all types of tracers, the pre-event contribution is 10 between 74‐82%. At the larger scale (26km 2 ), two sub-catchments contribute to the flow at the weir site in Bangalala. Using the hydrochemical tracers the calculated contributions for the sub-catchments are in agreement with the catchment size and rainfall contributions over these two catchments. This showed that at the weir site 20% of the total flow comes from event water (of which 2% from Vudee sub-catchment and 18% 15 from Ndolwa sub-catchment). The large di erence is mainly due to preceding wetness conditions. However, with the isotope tracers no unambiguous results could be obtained. Two end members have been investigated to account for the ambiguous nature of the isotopic concentrations. The rainfall analysis shows that during the season the isotopical 20 concentration changes, with a clear distinction between the two seasons. In addition, within one event the isotopic concentrations vary substantially within the area. The spring analysis also shows substantial temporal and spatial variation. The research therefore shows that the assumption of stable isotopic end-members was not met in our study. At the smaller scale the spatial variability could be neglected 25',\n",

We have recently shown that ETS-1 is a mediator of the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects of Angiotensin II in the kidney (HTN ’12). Herein, we tested the hypothesis that the renal expression of ETS-1 is increased in the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rat, a paradigm of salt-sensitive hypertension in humans, and that ETS-1 mediates renal injury in this model of hypertension. DS rats (n=6 per group) were fed a normal salt diet (0.5% NaCl, NS) or a high salt diet (4% NaCl, HS) for 4 weeks. Four additional groups (n=6 per group) on HS diet received: ETS-1 dominant negative peptide (HS/DN, 10mg/kg/day) to block ETS-1, a control ETS-1 mutant peptide (HS/MU, 10mg /kg/day), the AT1 receptor blocker Candesartan (HS/ARB 10 mg/kg/day) or a combination of DN and ARB (HS/DN/ARB). HS rats had a ~ 3 fold increase in the cortical expression of ETS-1 as assessed by western blot (WB). Treatment with DN, MU, ARB or DN/ARB resulted in small and non-significant reductions in BP as compared to HS. (Table). Compared with LS, HS rats had increased proteinuria (Bio-Rad), higher glomerular injury score (GIS), increased fibronectin expression (WB) and urinary TGF-β (ELISA) that were improved by DN but not by MU (table). ARB reduced proteinuria and GIS (table). Treatment with DN/ARB resulted in further improvements in renal injury as compared to DN and ARB (table).   In conclusion we have demonstrated that hypertensive DS rats have increased cortical expression of ETS-1 and that blockade of ETS-1 improves renal injury in this model of hypertension.',\n",

However, the inciting factors and mechanisms by which VUE contributes to adverse outcomes are poorly understood. This limits our ability to develop preventions or interventions. Our goals were to determine whether viruses can be detected in placental tissues with VUE and to determine whether gene expression profiles support an antiviral response.       Methods   We extracted RNA and DNA from 20 placentas with high-grade chronic villitis and 20 control placentas without inflammation. Viruses were assessed using ViroCap viral nucleic acid enrichment coupled with metagenomic sequencing. RNA sequencing was used to evaluate the inflammatory gene expression profiles in each placenta.       Results   We detected at least 1 virus in 50% of the samples tested. We found that herpesviruses, were found more frequently in cases compared with controls (P\\xa0=\\xa00.01). Antiviral pathways, including defense response to virus, interferon gamma response, and IFN alpha/beta response, were upregulated in cases. We observed two clusters of gene expression profiles in the VUE cases, suggesting multiple inflammatory profiles are associated with VUE.       Discussion   These data support a viral etiology for some cases of VUE. Furthermore, gene expression profiles suggest the possibility of more than one cause or manifestation of VUE. Viral mechanisms should be explored as potential targets for prevention or intervention in VUE.',\n",

We investigated geographic variation in the vocal signals of magpies residing in South Korea and Japan (subspecies sericea). Based on the magpie’s limited dispersal ability, we predicted that the variation in vocal signals of black-billed magpies could be explained by geographic barriers such as mountain ranges and straits. We analyzed four-syllable chatter calls of magpies from five localities in South Korea, which are separated by mountain ranges (Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Gwangju, and Busan), and two island localities separated from the mainland by straits (Jeju in Korea and Saga in Japan). We found significant differences in the characteristics of magpie chatter calls recorded in the seven localities, and the variation pattern was independent among the variables. Mainland-island differentiation and north-south differentiation were observed. In general, magpies on Saga were the most distinctive. North-south differentiation was observed among the Korean mainland localities. However, the pattern was not related to the presence of putative geographic barriers. We hypothesize that the patterns of geographic variation in the structure of magpie chatter calls residing in South Korea might have been shaped by a sudden expansion of magpies followed by low level of local isolation, which may have led to vocal differentiation. Along with elucidating the vocal environment of Korean magpie populations, more extensive sampling is needed to clarify the functional aspects of geographic variation in the vocal signals of Korean magpies.',\n",

Most patients had baseline neuroimaging performed prior to the initiation of ERT. Follow-up neuroimaging was performed in eight.       Results   Sixteen patients (70%) had neuroimaging abnormalities consisting of ventricular enlargement (VE) and/or extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid accumulation (EACSF) at baseline, with delayed myelination in two. Follow-up neuroimaging (n\\xa0=\\xa08) after 6–153\\xa0months showed marked improvement, with normalization of VE and EACSF in seven patients.

       "  'abstract': 'The power consumption of digital circuits is proportional to the square of operation voltage and the demand for low power circuits reduces the operation voltage towards the threshold of MOSFETs. A weak voltage signal makes circuits vulnerable to noise and the optimization of circuit design requires modelling noise. Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) is the dominant noise for modern CMOS technologies and Monte Carlo modelling has been used to assess its impact on circuits. This requires statistical distributions of RTN amplitude and three different distributions were proposed by early works: Lognormal, Exponential, and Gumbel distributions. They give substantially different RTN predictions and agreement has not been reached on which distribution should be used, calling the modelling accuracy into questions. The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy of these three distributions and to explore other distributions for better accuracy. A novel criterion has been proposed for selecting distributions, which requires a monotonic reduction of modelling errors with increasing number of traps. The three existing distributions do not meet this criterion and thirteen other distributions are explored. It is found that the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution has the lowest error and meet the new criterion. Moreover, to reduce modelling errors, early works used bimodal Lognormal and Exponential distributions, which have more fitting parameters. Their errors, however, are still higher than those of the monomodal GEV distribution. GEV has a long distribution tail and predicts substantially worse RTN impact. The work highlights the uncertainty in predicting the RTN distribution tail by different statistical models.',\n",

It can infect individuals with active HBV infection and cause severe liver disease. It is less prevalent than hepatitis B virus, but it causes more serious clinical pictures. In this study we investigated anti-HDV seroprevalance and epidemiological features among HBsAg seropositive outclinic patients at Izmir Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital.         Methodology: Serum samples collected from outpatients at Izmir Tepecik Educational and Research Hospital between 1 September 2007 and 30 August 2009 were evaluated.

Results: Out of 3,094 HBsAg positive patients, 79 (2.5%) had anti-HDV IgG seroprevalance. Of these 79 patients, 42 were hepatitis B carriers, 34 had chronic hepatitis B, two had liver cirrhosis, and one had hepatocellular carcinoma.     Conclusion: Although superinfection and co-infection of HDV are less prevalent than hepatitis B infection, the prognosis is worse as the response to therapy is poor; therefore, patients with hepatitis B should be evaluated further for HDV infection.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract. Nucleation experiments starting from the reaction of OH radicals with SO2 have been performed in the IfT-LFT flow tube under atmospheric conditions at 293±0.5 K for a relative humidity of 13–61%. The presence of different additives (H2, CO, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene) for adjusting the OH radical concentration and resulting OH levels in the range (4–300) ×105 molecule cm−3 did not influence the nucleation process itself. The number of detected particles as well as the threshold H2SO4 concentration needed for nucleation was found to be strongly dependent on the counting efficiency of the used counting devices. High-sensitivity particle counters allowed the measurement of freshly nucleated particles with diameters down to about 1.5 nm. A parameterization of the experimental data was developed using power law equations for H2SO4 and H2O vapour. The exponent for H2SO4 from different measurement series was in the range of 1.7–2.1 being in good agreement with those arising from analysis of nucleation events in the atmosphere. For increasing relative humidity, an increase of the particle number was observed. The exponent for H2O vapour was found to be 3.1 representing an upper limit. Addition of 1.2×1011 molecule cm−3 or 1.2×1012 molecule cm−3 of NH3 (range of atmospheric NH3 peak concentrations) revealed that NH3 has a measureable, promoting effect on the nucleation rate under these conditions. The promoting effect was found to be more pronounced for relatively dry conditions, i.e. a rise of the particle number by 1–2 orders of magnitude at RH = 13% and only by a factor of 2–5 at RH = 47% (NH3 addition: 1.2×1012 molecule cm−3). Using the amine tert-butylamine instead of NH3, the enhancing impact of the base for nucleation and particle growth appears to be stronger. Tert-butylamine addition of about 1010 molecule cm−3 at RH = 13% enhances particle formation by about two orders of magnitude, while for NH3 only a small or negligible effect on nucleation in this range of concentration appeared. This suggests that amines can strongly influence atmospheric H2SO4-H2O nucleation and are probably promising candidates for explaining existing discrepancies between theory and observations.',\n",

Here we investigate the impacts on northern midlatitude cirrus from continuous SO2emissions of 2–10\\u2009Mt/a in the tropical stratosphere. Transport of geoengineering aerosols into the troposphere was calculated along trajectories based on ERA Interim reanalyses using ozone concentrations to quantify the degree of mixing of stratospheric and tropospheric air termed “troposphericity”. Modeled size distributions of the geoengineered H2SO4-H2O droplets have been fed into a cirrus box model with spectral microphysics. The geoengineering is predicted to cause changes in ice number density by up to 50%, depending on troposphericity and cooling rate. We estimate the resulting cloud radiative effects from a radiation transfer model. Complex interplay between the few large stratospheric and many small tropospheric H2SO4-H2O droplets gives rise to partly counteracting radiative effects: local increases in cloud radiative forcing up to +2\\u2009W/m2for low troposphericities and slow cooling rates, and decreases up to −7.5\\u2009W/m2for high troposphericities and fast cooling rates. The resulting mean impact on the northern midlatitudes by changes in cirrus is predicted to be low, namely <1% of the intended radiative forcing by the stratospheric aerosols. This suggests that stratospheric sulphate geoengineering is unlikely to have large microphysical effects on the mean cirrus radiative forcing. However, this study disregards feedbacks, such as temperature and humidity changes in the upper troposphere, which must be examined separately.',\n",

In nature, lignocellulosic biomass is mainly decomposed by fungi. We recently identified six efficient cellulose degraders by screening fungi from Vietnam. We characterized a high-performance cellulase-producing strain, with an activity of 0.06 U/mg, which was identified as a member of the Fusarium solani species complex linkage 6 (Fusarium metavorans), isolated from mangrove wood (FW16.1, deposited as DSM105788). The genome, representing nine potential chromosomes, was sequenced using PacBio and Illumina technology. In-depth secretome analysis using six different synthetic and artificial cellulose substrates and two agro-industrial waste products identified 500 proteins, including 135 enzymes assigned to five different carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) classes. The F. metavorans enzyme cocktail was tested for saccharification activity on pre-treated sugarcane bagasse, as well as untreated sugarcane bagasse and maize leaves, where it was complemented with the commercial enzyme mixture Accellerase 1500. In the untreated sugarcane bagasse and maize leaves, initial cell wall degradation was observed in the presence of at least 196\\xa0µg/mL of the in-house cocktail.

In the context of this hypothesis, little is known on whether individual differences in neural processing capacity account for aspects of 'variation' observed in symbolic behavior and symbolic systems. We addressed this issue in the domain of auditory processing. We conducted a combined behavioral and EEG study on 2 successive days. On day 1, participants listened to standard and deviant five-tone sequences: as in previous oddball studies, an mismatch negativity (MMN) was elicited by deviant tones. On day 2, participants learned an artificial signaling system from a trained confederate of the experimenters in a coordination game in which five-tone sequences were associated to affective meanings (emotion-laden pictures of human faces). In a subsequent game with identical structure, participants transmitted and occasionally changed the signaling system learned during the first game. The MMN latency from day 1 predicted learning, transmission and structural modification of signaling systems on day 2. Our study introduces neurophysiological methods into research on cultural transmission and evolution, and relates aspects of variation in symbolic systems to individual differences in neural information processing.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In models extensively used in studies of aging and extended lifespan, such as C. elegans and Drosophila, adult senescence is regulated by gene networks that are likely to be similar to ones that underlie lifespan extension during dormancy. These include the evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF, TOR and germ line-signaling pathways. Dormancy, also known as dauer stage in the larval worm or adult diapause in the fly, is triggered by adverse environmental conditions, and results in drastically extended lifespan with negligible senescence. It is furthermore characterized by increased stress resistance and somatic maintenance, developmental arrest and reallocated energy resources. In the fly Drosophila melanogaster adult reproductive diapause is additionally manifested in arrested ovary development, improved immune defense and altered metabolism. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this adaptive lifespan extension are not well understood. A genome wide analysis of transcript changes in diapausing D. melanogaster revealed a differential regulation of more than 4600 genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis reveal that many of these genes are part of signaling pathways that regulate metabolism, stress responses, detoxification, immunity, protein synthesis and processes during aging. More specifically, gene readouts and detailed mapping of the pathways indicate downregulation of insulin-IGF (IIS), target of rapamycin (TOR) and MAP kinase signaling, whereas Toll-dependent immune signaling, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways are upregulated during diapause. Furthermore, we detected transcriptional regulation of a large number of genes specifically associated with aging and longevity. We find that many affected genes and signal pathways are shared between dormancy, aging and lifespan extension, including IIS, TOR, JAK/STAT and JNK. A substantial fraction of the genes affected by diapause have also been found to alter their expression in response to starvation and cold exposure in D. melanogaster, and the pathways overlap those reported in GO analysis of other invertebrates in dormancy or even hibernating mammals. Our study, thus, shows that D. melanogaster is a genetically tractable model for dormancy in other organisms and effects of dormancy on aging and lifespan.',\n",

The analysis shows that security properties (secrecy of keys, including backward/forward secrecy, immunity from off-line guessing attacks, and network components authentication) hold almost as expected in nominal conditions, i.e. when all backhaul links are secured and all backhaul nodes are trusted. The paper also analyses how these security properties are affected by possible anomalous situations, such as a compromised backhaul node or a misconfiguration by which a backhaul link becomes not protected and can be accessed by an attacker. The analysis shows that some security properties hold even in these adverse cases while other properties are compromised.

The model is motivated by the need from imaging-genetic studies to identify genetic variants that are associated with brain imaging phenotypes, often in the form of high dimensional tensor fields. GRRLF identifies from the structure in the data the effective dimensionality of the data, and then jointly performs dimension reduction of the covariates, dynamic identification of latent factors, and nonparametric estimation of both covariate and latent response fields. After accounting for the latent and covariate effects, GRLLF performs a nonparametric test on the remaining factor of interest. GRRLF provides a better factorization of the signals compared with common solutions, and is less susceptible to overfitting because it exploits the effective dimensionality. The generality and the flexibility of GRRLF also allow various statistical models to be handled in a unified framework and solutions can be efficiently computed. Within the field of neuroimaging, it improves the sensitivity for weak signals and is a promising alternative to existing approaches. The operation of the framework is demonstrated with both synthetic datasets and a real-world neuroimaging example in which the effects of a set of genes on the structure of the brain at the voxel level were measured, and the results compared favorably with those from existing approaches.',\n",

While archaeological material may not always be visible on the surface, particular settlement patterns may be identifiable by a topography created through cultural action: earthen mounds interchanging with mostly circular flattened areas. In northern Hispaniola, recent foot surveys have identified more than 200 pre-colonial sites of which several have been mapped in high resolution. In addition, three settlements with topographical characteristics have been extensively excavated, confirming that the mounds and flattened areas may have had a cultural connotation in this region. Without the availability of high resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, a photogrammetric approach using UAS (unmanned aircraft system, commonly known as drones) can fill the knowledge gap on a local scale, providing fast and reliable data collection and precise results. After photogrammetric processing, digital clearance of vegetation, and extraction of the georeferenced DEM (digital elevation model) and orthophoto, filters and enhancements provide an opportunity to visualize the results in GIS. The outcome provides an overview of site size, and distribution of mounds and flattened areas. Measurement of the topographic changes in a variety of past settlements defines likely zones of habitat, and provides clues on the actual dimensions and density of living space. Understanding the relation of the mounds and adjacent flat areas within their environment allows a discussion on how, and for what purpose, the settlement was founded at a particular location, and provides clues about its spatial organization.',\n",

Moreover, the nanocavities of cyclodextrin nanosponges were exploited for immobilization of heteropolyacids through the wet impregnation method. This catalyst exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to the bare cyclodextrin nanosponge. Despite the good catalytic activity, the leaching of the catalytic species did not allow efficient recovery and reusability. To circumvent this problem, the cyclodextrin nanosponge was amine-functionalized prior to heteropolyacid immobilization. The results proved that the amine functionalities had an effective role in preserving the catalytic species and improving the reusability through decreasing the leaching time. This catalyst was used for synthesis of a variety of xanthenes in aqueous media. The catalytic amount of catalyst afforded the desired product in excellent yields and with a relatively short reaction time.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a good modality for evaluation of both esophageal wall and mediastinal lymph nodes. The objectives were to study the role of EUS in diagnosing esophageal tuberculosis, to differentiate primary from secondary form, and to assess the response. Retrospective analysis of data over 7 years (i.e. from 2003 to 2009) was used. The study was set in a tertiary care referral institute and focused on patients diagnosed with esophageal tuberculosis. Interventions used included endoscopy, EUS, EUS-FNA (fine needle aspiration) followed by antituberculosis treatment. The main outcome measurements were symptoms, endoscopic features, EUS features, pathological yield, and response to treatment. There were 32 cases of esophageal tuberculosis. The primary symptom was dysphagia, and endoscopy showed ulcers in 18/32 (56.25%) and extrinsic bulge in 20/32 (62.5%) in middle one third of esophagus. EUS showed lymph nodes adjacent to esophageal pathology in all cases. Subcarinal region was the most common site of lymphadenopathy and they were matted, heterogeneous with predominantly hypoechoic center. Histopathology of endoscopic biopsy of ulcers and EUS-FNA of lymph nodes provided the diagnosis of tuberculosis in 27/32 (84.35%). All patients were treated with antitubercular treatment and showed good clinical, endoscopic and endosonographic response. This is a retrospective study, and PCR and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were not done. Esophageal tuberculosis does not appear to be a primary disease and is most likely secondary to mediastinal nodal tuberculosis. A conglomerated mass of heterogeneous with predominantly hypoechoic lymph nodes with intervening hyperechoic strands and foci on EUS appears to be characteristic of mediastinal tuberculosis.',\n",

In this study, HfO2 films are deposited on n-type c-Si using remote plasma atomic layer deposition (RP-ALD). Post-annealing is performed using a rapid thermal processing system at different temperatures in nitrogen ambient for 10 min. The effects of post-annealing temperature on the passivation properties of the HfO2 films on c-Si are investigated.

By means of modeling and numerical computer simulation, the influence of different front surface recombination velocity (SRV) and rear SRV on n-type silicon solar cell performance was investigated. Simulation results show that the n-type PERC solar cell with HfO2 single layer can have a conversion efficiency of 22.1%. The PERC using silicon nitride/HfO2 stacked passivation layer can further increase efficiency to 23.02% with an open-circuit voltage of 689 mV.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We have previously reported that a malfunction of RXRα due to aberrant phosphorylation at serine 260 by MAPK is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The phosphorylated RXRα impairs normal receptor functions of either RXR or RAR, which are respective homodimeric or heterodimeric partner of RXRα, in a dominant-negative manner. Besides, these impaired receptor functions result in the downregulation of their target gene expression and inducing hepatocarcinogenesis by stimulating cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting that phosphorylated RXRα plays a crucial role in the development of HCC. However, these findings were revealed primarily using HCC cell lines that express the phosphorylated-RXRα (p-RXRα) proteins and it still remains unclear whether p-RXRα may impact in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. Therefore, in order to investigate the biological functions of p-RXRα on hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo, we generated doxycycline-inducible ES cell line and transgenic mouse, both of which overexpress phosphomimic mutant of RXRα (T82D/S260D). Interestingly, the transcriptional activities of Retinoid X Receptor Response Element (RXRE) were significantly reduced in the Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from the transgenic mice, suggesting that the retinoid signaling via RXRα were impaired in the mice. Moreover, the development of liver tumors induced by liver carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was enhanced in the transgenic mice that overexpress T82D/S260D protein in the liver. Notably, the increased liver tumors in the transgenic mice resulted from the promotion of cell cycle progression, not the inhibition of apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of β-catenin and its target genes, cyclin D1 and c-myc, were increased in transgenic liver tumors, although the expression of retinoid-related genes, such as RARβ, p21 and p27, were not altered compared with control mice. These results suggest that the phospho-modification of RXRα may promote the development of DEN-induced liver tumors through the activation of β-catenin signaling pathways in mice.

Thus, tracers can affect the groundwater flow mechanics and data interpretation becomes more complex, hindering effective study of ground heat pumps for low enthalpy geothermal systems. This paper presents a preliminary methodology based on a multidisciplinary application of heat as a tracer for defining the main parameters of shallow aquifers. The field monitoring techniques electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) are noninvasive and were applied to a shallow-aquifer test site in northeast Italy. The combination of these measurement techniques supports the definition of the main aquifer parameters and therefore the construction of a reliable conceptual model, which is then described through the numerical code FEFLOW. This model is calibrated with DTS and validated by ERT outcomes. The reliability of the numerical model in terms of fate and transport is thereby enhanced, leading to the potential for better environmental management and protection of groundwater resources through more cost-effective solutions.',\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Trust and property rights are generally considered to influence farmers' behavior regarding resource use and environmental management. Previous studies show that higher trust levels may enhance contributions to public goods. This paper investigates how trust and (land) property rights security influence the provision of one concrete public good: land protection through the Sloping Land Conservation Program in China. The analysis is based on household survey data from Ningxia Autonomous Region in China. From our questionnaire two trust factors are derived and distinguished, using factor analysis: general trust and kinship trust. Farm households are less likely to contribute to public goods when they perceive more secure land rights, but trust has mixed effects on public goods. The results show that general trust and kinship trust may rely on two opposite effects for influencing public goods provision. On the one hand, high levels of general trust may directly enhance people's willingness to provide contributions to public goods (by reduced likelihood to reconvert forest land) when farmers are aware of the positive environmental effects of the program, that's the public goods effect. On the other hand, general trust may also make it more likely that people invest more in their own private goods to pursue their own welfare (a more likely reconversion of forest land to arable land), that's the private goods effect. The final outcome depends on the size and direction of both effects. Compared to general trust, kinship trust is more inward-looking and self- or group-interested compared to more reciprocal general trust. Thus, unlike general trust, kinship trust may have no significant public goods effect on the provisioning of public goods.\",\n",

Sample-wide, Garisakang cortisol concentrations are highest upon waking (mean\\u2009=\\u20094.86\\u2009nmol/L) and decrease throughout the day at a mean rate of only -0.18\\u2009nmol/L/h or -6.20%/h. Age and sex significantly predict evaluated cortisol parameters in ways not consistently reported among industrialized populations, suggesting that Garisakang diurnal cortisol rhythms are defined by distinct ontogenetic trajectories across the lifespan. These findings highlight cross-cultural diversity in HPA activity and have important implications for understanding basic mechanisms of the physiological stress response in contexts of chronic physical stressors such as limited nutrition, heavy burden of infectious disease, and high levels of physical activity.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The major malaria vectors of Papua New Guinea exhibit heterogeneities in distribution, biting behaviour and malaria infection levels. Long-lasting, insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), distributed as part of the National Malaria Control Programme, are the primary intervention targeting malaria transmission. This study evaluated the impact of LLINs on anopheline density, species composition, feeding behaviour, and malaria transmission. Mosquitoes were collected by human landing catch in 11 villages from East Sepik Province and Madang Province. Mosquitoes were collected for 3\\xa0years (1\\xa0year before distribution and 2\\xa0years after), and assayed to determine mosquito species and Plasmodium spp. infection prevalence. The influence of weather conditions and the presence of people and animals on biting density was determined. Determinants of biting density and sporozoite prevalence were analysed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). Mosquito biting rates and entomological inoculation rates decreased significantly after the distribution. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax sporozoite prevalence decreased in year 2, but increased in year 3, suggesting the likelihood of resurgence in transmission if low biting rates are not maintained. An earlier shift in the median biting time of Anopheles punctulatus and An. farauti s.s. was observed. However, this was not accompanied by an increase in the proportion of infective bites occurring before 2200\\xa0hours. A change in species composition was observed, which resulted in dominance of An. punctulatus in Dreikikir region, but a decrease in An. punctulatus in the Madang region. When controlling for village and study year, An. farauti s.s., An. koliensis and An. punctulatus were equally likely to carry P. vivax sporozoites. However, An. punctulatus was significantly more likely than An. farauti s.s. (OR 0.14; p\\xa0=\\xa00.007) or An. koliensis (OR 0.27; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) to carry P. falciparum sporozoites. LLINs had a significant impact on malaria transmission, despite exophagic and crepuscular feeding behaviours of dominant vectors. Changes in species composition and feeding behaviour were observed, but their epidemiological significance will depend on their durability over time.',\n",

Therefore, we investigated the tumorigenic potential of S100A7 over expression in ERα+ breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.\\n\\nMethods: The tumorigenicity of stably over-expressing S100A7 and vector control ERα+ cell lines was assessed using proliferation, migration and wound healing assays. Microarray analysis was carried out to determine the tumorigenic mechanisms associated with S100A7 over-expression and the validation of the targets was performed using real time PCR and immunoblotting. In vivo effect of S100A7 over-expression on tumorigenicity was analyzed using xenograft mouse models and the tumors derived from these mice were analyzed using immunohistochemistry.\\n\\nResults: S100A7 over-expressing ERα+ cells showed significantly reduced EGF-induced proliferation, migration and wound healing compared to vector control cells. Characterization of the EGF-mediated signaling pathways revealed reduced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK in S100A7 over-expressing cells. We also observed decreased mRNA and protein levels of β-catenin pathway associated genes -TCF4 and cyclinD1 in S100A7 over-expressing cells. Further analysis of β-catenin /TCF4 pathway showed reduced expression of β-catenin and increased expression of GSK3β and phospho β-catenin in S100A7 over-expressing cells. In addition, we found decreased expression of c-myc and cyclin D1 which are downstream targets of β-catenin/TCF4 pathway. Next, we observed enhanced interaction of E-cadherin and β-catenin in the membranes of S100A7 over-expressing cells. We also observed decreased Rac activation and actin polymerization in S100A7 over-expressing cells which may account for their reduced migration. Finally, we demonstrated that S100A7 over-expressing cells decreased tumor formation in nude mouse model. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical analysis showed down regulation of Cyclin D1 and β-catenin and increased expression of E-cadherin in S100A7 over-expressing tumors, thus confirming the reduced activation of β-catenin/TCF4 pathway in vivo.\\n\\nConclusions: We conclude that S100A7 decreases the tumorigenicity of ERα+ cells by down modulating β-catenin/TCF4 pathway both in vitro and in vivo. S100A7 is normally associated with increased tumorigenicity in ERα− breast cancer but our results suggest that S100A7 may have a differential role in ERα+ and ERα− cells. Our studies indicate that S100A7 could act as a novel therapeutic target for drug resistant ERα+ breast tumors.\\n\\nCitation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract].

The purpose of this study was to assess for differences in latencies and deactivation times of scapular muscles between subjects with and without shoulder impingement. Twenty-five healthy subjects and 24 subjects with impingement symptoms were recruited. Glenohumeral kinematic data and myoelectric activities using surface electrodes from upper trapezius (UT), lower trapezius (LT), serratus anterior (SA) and anterior fibers of deltoid were collected as subjects raised and lowered their arm in response to a visual cue. Data were collected during unloaded, loaded and after repetitive arm raising motion conditions. The variables were analyzed using 2 or 3 way mixed model ANOVAs. Subjects with impingement demonstrated significantly earlier contraction of UT while raising in the unloaded condition and an earlier deactivation of SA across all conditions during lowering of the arm. All subjects exhibited an earlier activation and delayed deactivation of LT and SA in conditions with a weight held in hand. The subjects with impingement showed some significant differences to indicate possible differences in motor control strategies. Rehabilitation measures should consider appropriate training measures to improve movement patterns and muscle control.',\n",

Multiple lines of evidences suggest that the k receptor modulates overlapping neurocircuits connecting brainstem monoaminergic nuclei with forebrain limbic structures and thereby regulates neurobiological effects of stress and psychostimulants. The emerging concept of “biased agonism” (also known as functional selectivity) for G Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) ligands have provided new insights into overall response generated by a ligand, which could be exploited for drug discovery. According to this concept, every ligand possesses the unique ability (coded in its structure) that dictates distinct signalling pattern, and consequently beneficial or adverse response. Although still a long way to comprehend the clinical potential of biased GPCR ligands, such ligand could be vital pharmacological probes. This article highlights various lines of evidence, which indicates different ligands of k receptor as “biased”, and their potential implications in mood and pain disorders.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model predicts that postzygotic isolation evolves due to the accumulation of incompatible epistatic interactions, but few studies have quantified the relationship between genetic architecture and patterns of reproductive divergence. We examined how the direction and magnitude of epistatic interactions in a polygenic trait under stabilizing selection influenced the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities. We found that populations evolving independently under stabilizing selection experienced suites of compensatory allelic changes that resulted in genetic divergence between populations despite the maintenance of a stable, high-fitness phenotype. A small number of loci were then incompatible with multiple alleles in the genetic background of the hybrid and the identity of these incompatibility loci changed over the evolution of the populations. For F 1   hybrids, reduced fitness evolved in a window of intermediate strengths of epistatic interactions, but F 2   and backcross hybrids evolved reduced fitness across weak and moderate strengths of epistasis due to segregation variance. Strong epistatic interactions constrained the allelic divergence of parental populations and prevented the development of reproductive isolation. Because many traits with varying genetic architectures must be under stabilizing selection, our results indicate that polygenetic drift is a plausible hypothesis for the evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation.',\n",

Hitherto, little is known about wave propagation in a snowpack caused by an explosion. During the winter 2013–2014 we performed field experiments on a flat study site. We triggered slurry explosive charges at different heights above the snow surface. At three different distances from the point of explosion we measured surface air pressure and accelerations of the snowpack at various depths. Cameras were placed in the snow pits for recording weak layer failure and crack propagation. We report empirical relations for the decay of near-surface air pressure, accelerations, displacement velocities and displacement with distance from the explosion and depth within the snowpack. Waves within the snowpack arrived earlier at the sensors than the corresponding air pressure waves at the microphones. Air pressure decayed stronger than accelerations within the snowpack. Weak layer failure mainly happened in the top part of the snowpack. We observed two types of weak layer failure, one caused by the direct impact of the air pressure wave close to the point of observation, the other by failure induced by the air pressure wave closer to the point of explosion and subsequent crack propagation. Our measurements increase the understanding of acoustic wave propagation in snow and can be used for comparison with numerical simulations.',\n",

This work was carried out with a retrospective cohort of 261 patients, their evolution from diagnoses, laboratory tests, and variables recorded during haemodialysis sessions was combined. Random forest (RF) was used to explore the inference of the variables and define a base performance for long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Then, LSTMs were trained with several groups of variables chosen by expert staff, the ones found by RF and all the available ones. The best performance was obtained using all the variables, but the ones found by RF had better predictive capacity than those chosen with expert knowledge. Integrating the three sources of information supposes an improvement in more than 4% in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The approach is sufficiently robust to predict mortality at different time ranges. The massive integration of variables from patients in ESRD, together with the use of LSMTs, supposes an exceptional improvement in the predictive models of mortality. In conclusion, the machine learning approach can lead to a change in the paradigm in the analysis of predictive factors in mortality in ESRD.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that alters cortical excitability and activity in a polarity-dependent way. Stimulation for a few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be related to stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function by functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis of the BOLD fMRI spontaneous activity. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10-min bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. For each dataset, grey matter voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal connectivity degree and minimum path length maps were calculated and compared before and after tDCS. Nodal minimum path lengths significantly increased in the left somatomotor (SM1) cortex after anodal tDCS, which means that the number of direct functional connections from the left SM1 to topologically distant grey matter voxels significantly decreased. In contrast, functional coupling between premotor and superior parietal areas with the left SM1 significantly increased. Additionally, the nodal connectivity degree in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) area as well as in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right DLPFC) significantly increased. In summary, we provide initial support that tDCS-induced neuroplastic alterations might be related to functional connectivity changes in the human brain. Additionally, we propose our approach as a powerful method to track for neuroplastic changes in the human brain.',\n",

It is comprised by an upper ‘sedimentary’ channel formed by an upper section of detrital and volcanic rocks thrusted on top of pelagic sediments scrapped off the oceanic floor. This sedimentary melange is thrusted on top of an intensely deformed tectonic melange. The tectonic melange comprises blocks of basalt from the oceanic floor and a focussed deformation zone 50–100 m in width. This zone is mainly formed by mud-supported conglomerates exhibiting a chlorite + carbonate matrix with blocks of basalt, cross-cut by numerous chlorite-carbonate-epidote-albite veins. It overlies an undeformed ocean floor section. Superposed chlorite- and calcite-bearing veins in the melange evidence high fluid:rock ratios of 0.3–2.3, with varied δ18O and δ13C isotopic ratios (+17 < δ18O < +25‰; −7 < δ13C < +4‰), which agrees with fluid mixing between pelagic sediments and a hydrothermal component at temperatures ranging from 120 to 400 °C, and thus mixing between deep and shallow reservoirs along the subduction interface. These data show that the several fluid reservoirs situated along the interplate boundary could have been connected by high-magnitude co-seismic displacements along the subduction zone. These subduction channel features are confronted to other similar fossil examples and current settings, such as the Andes accretionary prism to propose a reconstructed geometry of the interplate contact zone from the surface to the base of the crust.',\n",

There he conducted and performed his own music, met with fellow composers and students, and distributed material on American music. During his travel, Copland kept a brief diary, a rare day-to-day account of Cold War diplomatic work that reveals how Cold War geopolitics mediated his musical evaluations. This article offers an annotated transcription of the diary, contextualized with select English- and Russian-language primary sources. ********** During March and April 1960, Aaron Copland and Lukas Foss spent four weeks in the Soviet Union, where they performed their own music, met with fellow composers and students, and distributed material on American music. Their tour symbolized hope that the arts and cultural figures might play a role in American-Soviet relations, although it was not immediately clear whether it would be conciliatory or competitive. Roy Harris, Ulysses Kay, Peter Mennin, and Roger Sessions had already toured the U.S.S.R. in 1958 as emissaries of the U.S. State Department, and the following year the Soviet Union dispatched six of its most prominent musicians to the U.S. (1) Copland and Foss traveled in 1960 largely for parity\\'s sake, so that each superpower had sent an equal number of cultural emissaries. Copland was at once an obvious and unlikely choice. Arguably America\\'s most prominent musician, he was widely known in the U.S.S.R., much more so than the 1958 composer-diplomats. Moreover, he was no stranger to diplomatic work, having undertaken state-sponsored tours to Latin America in the 1940s. (2) Yet Copland\\'s brush with Joseph McCarthy\\'s anticommunist campaign in 1953--largely the result of his involvement in pro-Soviet organizations and events--was still a fresh memory. (3) That he was selected for a State Department tour of the U.S.S.R. only seven years later testifies to the rapid thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations that followed Nikita Khrushchev\\'s 1956 promise to scale back hard-line policy and foster communication with the West. (4) Copland\\'s interest in Soviet music predated the Cold War. Already in the mid-1930s, for example, he expressed interest in linking the New York Composers\\' Collective with the Union of Soviet Composers. During World War II, Copland served on a State Department subcommittee for exchange with the U.S.S.R., undertook leadership positions in several U.S.-Soviet \"friendship societies,\" and admired the socially progressive stance of select Soviet composers. (5) In 1960, however, an Iron Curtain divided the world, recent diplomatic efforts notwithstanding. Copland\\'s tour raises questions as to how he triangulated his own preconceptions, geopolitical pressures, and the ostensible goals of cultural diplomacy. Throughout his 1960 trip, Copland documented these tensions in a brief diary, a rare day-to-day account of Cold War diplomatic work. His chronicle, in which themes of technical innovation and competition are evident, suggests Cold War geopolitics at least in part colored his musical evaluations. A transcription of the diary follows, (6) contextualized for the first time with select English- and Russian-language primary sources. Of particular interest is the diary\\'s relation to a post-tour report Copland published in the New York Herald Tribune (see n. 72), an important Cold War document that has received little scholarly attention. TOUR PREPARATIONS, 1959-60 Copland seems to have been the first choice for the tour, a State Department representative having approached him already in the summer of 1959, soon after the Soviets revealed the unanticipated size of their delegation. (7) He eagerly agreed, and even discussed plans with the visiting Soviet musicians during their New York residency. (8) The State Department initially hoped to send also the arch-modernist Elliott Carter as a foil for Copland, who, whatever his recent adaptation of twelve-tone music, was still the face of American folk-influenced populism. …',\n",

As expected, virus neutralization tests using homologous virus were able to differentiate the two groups infected by BVDV-1 or atypical pestivirus, whereas the animals inoculated with a mixture of these two viruses had a reaction pattern very similar to the homologous virus alone. It was found that immunoassays using whole virus and polyclonal antibodies are the most robust, but all tests examined were able to detect antibodies also from cattle infected with atypical pestivirus a few weeks after infection. The detection, however, was at a lower level and slightly delayed.

This study aimed to evaluate whether the serum UA level was associated with the disease progression of PD in a relatively large population of Chinese patients. METHODS Serum UA levels were measured from 411 Chinese PD patients and 396 age-matched controls; following the uric acid colorimetric method, the serum creatinine (Scr) levels were also measured to reduce the bias caused by possible differences in renal excretion function. The disease progression was scored by Hoehn and Yahr (HY PD group was divided into 3 subgroups according to H&Y scales. Independent-samples t test was performed to analyze the differences between PD group and control group. Multiple analysis of covariance was performed to analyze the differences between PD subgroups. Spearman rank-correlation was performed to evaluate the associations between serum UA or Scr level and disease progression. RESULTS PD patients were found to have significantly lower levels of serum UA than controls ((243.38 ± 78.91) vs. (282.97 ± 90.80) µmol/L, P < 0.01). As the disease progression, the serum UA levels were gradually reduced. There was a significantly inverse correlation of UA levels with H&Y scales (Rs = -0.429, P < 0.01) and disease duration (Rs = -0.284, P < 0.01) in PD patients of both females and males. No significant difference of the Scr level between PD patients and controls was found ((70.01 ± 14.70) vs. (69.84 ± 16.46) µmol/L), and the Scr level was not involved in disease progression. CONCLUSION Lower serum UA levels may possess a higher risk of PD, which may be a potential useful biomarker to indicate the progression of PD.\",\n",

Here we implement the stator by nesting 64 PZT stacks in 64 slots specifically cut in a thick metal ring and 64 block springs nested within another 64 slots to produce preloading on the PZT stacks. In this new design, the d33 mode of the PZT is used to excite the flexural vibrations of the stator, and fragility of the PZT ceramics and fatigue of the adhesive layer are no longer an issue. The working principle, FEM simulation, fabrication, and performance measurements of a prototype motor were demonstrated to validate the proposed ideas. Typical output of the prototype motor is no-load speed of 15 rpm and maximum torque of 7.96 N?m. Further improvement will potentially enhance its features by increasing the accuracy in fabrication and adopting appropriate frictional material into the interface between the stator and the rotor.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Pilot experiments involving the butchering of bird carcasses and the use of non-retouched flint flakes were performed. The executed actions comprised skinning and defeathering various avifaunal species (Circaetus gallicus and Gyps fulvus). The main aim of this experimental programme was to document the use-wear on flint implements employed in the treatment of the avifaunal carcasses in order to help researchers identify this activity in the archaeological record. An additional focus of this study concerned the experimental organic residues (soft tissue and feathers) associated with the bird species used in the experiments. For each residue type, a detailed chemical elemental analysis and morphological characterisation were performed, with the aim of creating an experimental database for comparison with the micro-residues that will potentially be found on archaeological stone tools. For microscopic observations, we employed both Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Light Microscopy (OLM). A detailed description of the use-wear features and residue types was achieved through a systematic comparison of micrographs taken with both techniques. In addition, EDS (energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy) was applied to determine the elemental composition of the residues. Taphonomic analysis of the bones of the carcasses used in the experimental programme was performed with the principal aim of comparing the distribution of cut marks on bones with the use-wear pattern on the lithic implements employed. Future developments of our research will improve the methodology by expanding the experimental programme and by applying it to archaeological collections (at sites where the processing of these kinds of animals has already been identified).',\n",

Mode of surfactant administration has evolved towards less invasive technique in the last few years. We randomised 58 preterm infants of 28-34 weeks of gestation with RDS within 6 h of birth to receive surfactant by InSurE or minimally invasive surfactant therapy (MIST). Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was used as primary respiratory support. The main objective was to compare the need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in first 72 h of life and secondarily hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (> grade 2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and composite outcome of BPD/mortality. We did not find any difference in need of IMV in first 72 h between MIST and InSurE (relative risk with MIST, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 1.32). No difference was observed in terms of hs PDA, IVH (> grade 2), BPD and composite outcome of BPD/mortality.Conclusion: There is no difference between MIST and InSurE in preterm neonates with RDS with NIPPV as a primary mode of respiratory support.

In the UK, one of the largest recent framework agreements for interpreting and translation was introduced between 2016 and 2017 in critical contexts for justice, including the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the police. These agreements involve new types of collaboration between new partners and agents in the delivery of interpreting and translation, who each have different aims, expectations, standards and working methods. This contribution examines these emerging complex collaborations, and is the result of a rare type of complex collaboration between academic researchers, framework contract-holders and managers, interpreters and translators, language service providers, professional associations, and users of translation and interpreting services, within the Transnational Organised Crime and Translation (TOCAT) project. The article reports on original research conducted during the TOCAT project, and outlines and evaluates some novel, complex and ethically challenging ‘translaborations’ in police settings. The collaborations discussed are complex because of the range of parties and actors involved and because of the challenging content and settings in which the police rely on interpreting and translation. ‘Translaboration’ is used here to encompass multiple evolving collaborations between different providers and users of interpreting and translation, policy makers, trainers and researchers. Important questions of translation quality and ethics in the management of large-scale framework contexts for public service delivery are raised.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Purpose: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a well-known vasodilatory factor and crucial hormone for adaptation to increased blood pressure. ANP plasma levels rise upon elevated cardiac afterload during aortic stenosis and, via guanylyl cyclase A, stimulate cardiomyocyte cGMP levels. Cardiac cGMP is considered as a protective second messenger which counteracts detrimental effects of the chronic β-adrenoceptor (β-AR)-mediated cAMP signaling. Previous studies analyzed cyclic nucleotide signaling mostly in advanced chronic heart disease. The purpose of this work was to investigate subcellular changes in cAMP/cGMP signaling and their interactions in early cardiac hypertrophy.\\n\\nMethods: We used a compensated cardiac hypertrophy model induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. Heart function was evaluated by echocardiography. Plasma ANP was quantified by ELISA. Heart rates were measured from ECG recordings in intact perfused Langendorff hearts. Cardiomyocyte (CM) contractility was analyzed by sarcomere shortening. To monitor cAMP in real time, we generated transgenic mice expressing the membrane targeted Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor pmEpac1, localized to the sarcolemma. Individual PDE activities were measured using a classical biochemical assay.\\n\\nResults: 8 weeks post TAC, animals developed mild hypertrophy accompanied by a 2-fold increase in plasma ANP levels. Unexpectedly, ANP could potentiate catecholamine-induced positive chronotropic response in TAC but not sham hearts, which was accompanied by enhanced contractility in single isolated TAC CMs. FRET analysis revealed increased β1- but decreased β2-AR-cAMP signals in TAC cells without any change in β-AR densities. Interestingly, local β2-AR-associated PDE effects were dramatically altered despite unchanged whole cell PDE activities. In particular, we could uncover a switch from the PDE3- to PDE2-dependent regulation of β2-AR-cAMP signals. Since these PDEs are inversely regulated by cGMP, we tested the effect of ANP on β2-AR signaling. We found a turnaround of the cGMP/cAMP crosstalk in this microdomain, which was due to PDE2 and PDE3 redistribution and did directly translate into functional response.\\n\\nConclusions: We could show that in compensated hypertrophy, elevated levels of ANP potentiate catecholamine-stimulated inotropic and chronotropic effects. This is achieved by a switch in PDE2- and PDE3-dependent regulation of β2-and β1-AR-cAMP signaling. We propose that in early cardiac disease, ANP might transiently compensate an increased demand on cardiac output.',\n",

Therefore, characterization of treatment-relevant tumor heterogeneity is necessary to develop more effective therapies in the future. Here, we uncovered population heterogeneity among PAX/FOXO1-positive alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma by characterizing prosurvival networks initiated by FGFR4 signaling. We found that FGFR4 signaling rescues only subgroups of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cells from apoptosis induced by compounds targeting the IGF1R-PI3K-mTOR pathway. Differences in both proapoptotic machinery and FGFR4-activated signaling are involved in the different behavior of the phenotypes. Proapoptotic stress induced by the kinase inhibitors is sensed by Bim/Bad in rescue cells and by Bmf in nonrescue cells. Anti-apoptotic ERK1/2 signaling downstream of FGFR4 is long-lasting in rescue and short-termed in most non-rescue cells. Gene expression analysis detected signatures specific for these two groups also in biopsy samples. The different cell phenotypes are present in different ratios in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and can be identified by AP2β expression levels.

Prolonged second stage of labour is associated with potentially fatal maternal complications such as haemorrhage and infection and it is a major cause of stillbirth and newborn morbidity and mortality. Currently, the three main options for managing prolonged second stage of labour are forceps, vacuum extractor and caesarean section. All three clinical practices require relatively expensive equipment (e.g., a surgical theatre for caesarean section) and/or highly trained staff which are often not available in low resource settings.

       "  'abstract': 'Global environmental change is increasingly affecting species worldwide. One of the emblematic casualties among plants in several European countries is common juniper (Juniperus communis). Many populations of common juniper throughout its distribution range are declining. The relative lack of viable seed production, resulting in low probabilities for successful natural regeneration, is one of the main reasons for this decline. Climate warming and elevated atmospheric depositions have been shown to negatively affect seed viability of common juniper, but our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains scarce. One possible pathway is via changes in the plant nutrient status that, in turn, may affect seed viability. Here we took advantage of large-scale gradients in climate and atmospheric depositions between central Sweden and northern Spain, and analysed foliar nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry and seed viability in 20 juniper populations spread across Europe. Our results show that increasing temperatures can negatively affect needle N and P concentrations while enhanced potentially acidifying depositions resulted in lower foliar N and Ca concentrations. Needle C:N ratios increased with higher temperature, acidifying depositions and precipitation. By linking these patterns to seed viability, we found that low needle P, Ca and Mg concentrations were related to low seed viability. Thus, a shortage of these key elements during seed development and seed nutrient storage, can lead to anomalies and seed abortion. These findings help to explain the low seed viability of juniper in Europe and may help to assist land managers to take urgently needed conservation actions.',\n",

Methods   This was a retrospective multi-centric case-control study, involving seven Centers for Cognitive Impairment and Dementia in Italy, on 448 consecutive patients aged 65 years old or older affected with AD. 197 patients were treated with an AChEI while 251 were treated with an AchEI + citicoline 1000 mg/day given orally. Cognitive functions were assessed by MMSE, daily life functions by ADL and IADL, behavioral symptoms by NPI, comorbidities by CIRS, and mood by GDS-short form. Tests were administered at baseline (T0), after 3 (T1), and 9 months (T2). The primary outcomes were effects of combined administration versus AChEIs given alone on cognitive functions assessed by MMSE. The secondary outcomes were possible side effects or adverse events of combination therapy versus AChEIs alone.   Results   Patients treated with citicoline plus an AChEI showed a statistically significant increase in MMSE between T0 and T1 (16.88±3.38 versus 17.62±3.64; p = 0.000) and between T1 and T2 (17.62±3.64 versus 17.89±3.54; p = 0.000).   Conclusion   The present study encourages the role of combined administration in disease management by slowing disease progression.\",\n",

The surface properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) techniques. The mean size of AgNPs, ranging from 3.2 to 6.0\\xa0nm, could be facilely controlled by merely varying the initial [extract], [CTAB], [starch], and [Ag+] ions.

Our findings suggest that ‘similarity’ biases are substantial, with jury members disproportionately voting for candidates from their own country, own national team, own continent and own league team. Further, we show that the impact of such biases on the total number of votes a candidate receives is fairly limited and hence is likely to affect the outcome of this competition only on rare occasions where the difference in quality between the leading candidates is small. Finally, analysing the incidence of ‘strategic voting’, we find jury members who vote for one leading candidate are more, rather than less, likely to also give points to his main competitor, as compared with neutral jury members. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of awards, elections and performance evaluation systems in general and for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award in particular.\",\n",

The Hopf Algebra was proposed to solve problems in wider fields: non-commutative geometry, combinatorics of renormalization in quantum field theory. These two approaches generate the recursive composition rules based on the dual structure. We proposed to reformulate the composition rule on the tree space. It is found to be much simpler and easier without using the dual structure. In this paper, the B-series approach is represented in a way that applications are based on the understanding of the meaning hiding behind the formulae. This also enables us to describe the Hopf algebra in B-series language without using the dual structure. In order to show that the B-series approach could be applied to solve problems which is not restricted to ordinary differential systems, we use an example which is solved using the Hopf Algebra approach. Through the demonstration of applying the B-series approach, we shows that the key of appying the B-series approach is to construct the elementary differential of the system.

Dyslipidemia exists in the majority of patients with DM and contributes to micro- and macrovascular complications associated with DM. Apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) is an inhibitor of the activity of lipoprotein lipase, which metabolizes triglyceride (TG) in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and facilitates its clearance from plasma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between apoCIII and MAU and the effects of atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes. In total, 120 subjects were divided into type 2 diabetes and type 2 DN groups, while 60 healthy subjects were selected as controls. The patients with DN were administered 20 mg atorvastatin daily for 16 weeks. Blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and levels of HbA1c, FBG, TG, VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C), apoCIII and MAU were markedly elevated in the type 2 diabetes and type 2 DN groups compared with those in the control group (P<0.01), while high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were decreased significantly (P<0.01). All patients with type 2 DN showed significantly elevated blood pressure, apoCIII levels, MAU, course of the disease and rate of stroke and retinopathy compared with the patients with type 2 diabetes (P<0.01). MAU was significantly positively correlated with the course of the disease, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, BMI and HbA1c, FBG, TG, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, VLDL-C and apoCIII levels (P<0.05), whereas negatively correlated with HDL-C levels (r=−0.194, P=0.020). Logistic regression analysis showed that apoCIII levels were independently associated with MAU (odds ratio, 1.100; 95% confidence interval, 1.037–1.153; P<0.001). Atorvastatin improved the lipid profile and MAU in patients with type 2 DN (P<0.01). Therefore, the present study demonstrated that an independent positive correlation exists between the levels of apoCIII and MAU in patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, atorvastatin may be used to improve the lipid profile and MAU in type 2 DN.',\n",

Currently, scholarship on big data is extending past work on the digital divide, theorizing a new big data divide. While this work most directly addresses the issues of ownership and access to big data, some work extends the divide to issues relating to skill and use. This extension opens up new complications relating to identity, social sorting, use, agency, and global development that are inextricably related to the issues above and to the study of big data. These issues go beyond the simple language of the digital divide extending inquiries into the realm of digital inequalities more generally.

We produce the required coherent plane wave illumination for Fourier ptychography over imaging areas 400 μm2 in size via adiabatically tapered single-mode waveguides and tackle the overlap constraints of the Fourier ptychography phase retrieval algorithm two-fold: firstly, the directionality of the illumination wave vector is changed sequentially via a multiplexed input structure of the waveguide chip layout and secondly, the wave vector modulus is shortend via step-wise increases of the illumination light wavelength over the visible spectrum. We test the method in simulations and in experiments and provide details on the underlying image formation theory as well as the reconstruction algorithm.

An accurate assessment of the physical phenomena taking place at the grain-scale is critical for a better understanding and modelling the mechanical behaviour of this material. This paper presents a study on the grain kinematics of shelly carbonate sand through analysis of in-situ 4D X-ray tomography images acquired during oedometer compression. Two sands from the Persian Gulf, with coarse and fine grading, were investigated. An adaptive watershed segmentation technique is used here to identify the grains in the image(s) prior to loading and a digital volume correlation (DVC) technique is employed to obtain the displacement field of each grain under loading. The displacement fields are used to reconstruct the grains in their new positions and compute the associated translation and rotation. An extensive statistical analysis was carried out to demonstrate the effect of grain morphology and local fabric (coordination number) on grain kinematics. The new findings presented here shed light on the mechanisms of grain rearrangement leading to the compressible fabric of shelly carbonate sands and, are also critical, to better understand other weak grained sands and/or silica sands with an open fabric.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Today, the employees stand firm as an integral part of the organization and are a precious asset. They are willing to learn, accept challenges and strive hard to deliver their level best. The role of the employees has become pronounced and significant, and it is no more conventional. They are now taking up responsibilities in strategic planning and development of the organization. Thus, HR department plays a profuse role in planning for the human resource of the firm to optimize the utilization of their potentials that would help support and meet the business as well as strategic goal of the firm. These HR planning programs ensure managing people within a planned framework and make them develop their performance that becomes a source of sustained competitive advantage for the firm. The paper aims to discuss these issues.,A descriptive research has been conducted with cross-sectional survey through a formalized questionnaire. Multistage sampling has been used in the study. Primary data have been collected from different manufacturing industries of India. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis have been conducted on the hypothesized research model. Structural equation modeling has been done to specify the relation between the measured and latent variables.,The HR planning programs, namely, staffing plan and succession plan, yield a better result in addressing the strategic goal of the company. Succession plan, staffing plan and talent management strategies augment the efficacious performance of the firm. Effectual performance aids in gaining a competitive advantage for the firm in a substantial way. Job analysis and design have no impact in achieving the strategic intent of the organization.,The study gives a comprehensive scenario of the HR planning programs that can help the organization to meet and uphold their strategic goals. The study provides a model that can solidify and bind the organization toward securing organizational intent and leading a steadfast business process in this dynamic competitive marketplace.',\n",

The survey covered 933 underground rooms located in 311 bank workplaces spread throughout in all Italian regions; at this scope the sampling was stratified random in order to be representative on national scale. The annual radon concentration was estimated by using passive radon dosemeters (NRPB/SSI type holder and CR-39 as detector): the devices were exposed for a period of about 3 months and 4 cycles were performed to cover a solar year. The radon levels in underground workplaces ranged from 27 to 4851\\xa0Bq/m 3   with an overall mean value of 153\\xa0Bq/m 3 . As expected, radon distribution is not uniform throughout Italy: in several regions high radon annual averages have been found, confirming previous surveys.

In this study doxycycline-inducible transgenes (NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC) were used to reprogram cat fetal fibroblasts with the objective of obtaining iPSC with fully silenced transgenes. Colony formation was slower (14 vs. 8 days) and at lower efficiency than mouse embryonic fibroblasts (0.002% vs. 0.02% of seeded cells). Alkaline-phosphatase positive colonies were grown on feeder cells plus LIF and GSK3, MEK, and ROCK inhibitors. Cells could be passaged singly and transgene expression was silenced at passage 3 (P3) after doxycycline removal at P2.

The photovoltaic performance of hybrid halide perovskite is linked to its atomic and electronic structure at the surface. Here we have used electronic structure calculations to determine the structural and electronic properties at the surface of MABX3 (MA = CH3NH3; B = Sn or Pb; X= I, Br, or Cl) perovskites. Next, we compared calculated electronic properties of the surface with the corresponding bulk values. Our results reveal that the structural properties like B-X distances, B-X-B angles, and orientation of MA are different between bulk to perovskite surface. Such changes in structural features at the perovskite surface lead to change in the band gap between surface and bulk perovskite. Both structural features and the band gap at the surface are found to be dependent on the crystal symmetry and chemistry of the perovskite. Further, for all perovskite compositions investigated, no midgap surface electronic states were observed.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'With the proliferation of social networks, group activities have become an essential ingredient of our daily life. A growing number of users share their group activities online and invite their friends to join in. This imposes the need of an in-depth study on the group recommendation task, i.e., recommending items to a group of users. Despite its value and significance, group recommendation remains an unsolved problem due to 1) the weights of group members are crucial to the recommendation performance but are rarely learnt from data; 2) social followee information is beneficial to understand users’ preferences but is rarely considered; and 3) user-item interactions are helpful to reinforce the performance of group recommendation but are seldom investigated. Toward this end, we devise neural network-based solutions by utilizing the recent developments of attention network and neural collaborative filtering (NCF). First of all, we adopt an attention network to form the representation of a group by aggregating the group members’ embeddings, which allows the attention weights of group members to be dynamically learnt from data. Second, the social followee information is incorporated via another attention network to enhance the representation of individual user, which is helpful to capture users’ personal preferences. Third, considering that many online group systems also have abundant interactions of individual users on items, we further integrate the modeling of user-item interactions into our method. Through this way, the recommendation for groups and users can be mutually reinforced. Extensive experiments on the scope of both macro-level performance comparison and micro-level analyses justify the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed approaches.',\n",

Aim of the study was to investigate whether socioeconomic position (SEP) interacts with a BMI-related genetic sum score (GRSBMI) to affect BMI in a population-based cohort. SEP-related health behaviors and a GRS associated with educational attainment (GRSEdu) were included in the analysis to explore potential interactions underlying the GRSBMIxSEP effect. Baseline information on SEP indicators (education, income), BMI, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and genetic risk factors were available for 4,493 participants of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. Interaction analysis was based on linear regression as well as on stratified analyses. In SEP-stratified analyses, the highest genetic effects were observed in the lowest educational group with a 0.24 kg/m2 higher BMI (95%CI: 0.16; 0.31) and in the lowest income quartile with a 0.14 kg/m2 higher BMI (95%CI: 0.09; 0.18) per additional risk allele. Indication for a GRSBMIxSEP interaction was observed for education (sGRSbmixeducation = -0.02 [95%CI:-0.03; -0.01]) and income (sGRSbmixincome = -0.05 [95%CI: -0.08; -0.02]). When adjusting for interactions with the GRSEdu and SEP-related health behaviors, effect size estimates of the GRSBMIxSEP interaction remained virtually unchanged. Results gave indication for an interaction of BMI-related genetic risk factors with SEP indicators, showing substantially stronger genetic effects in low SEP groups. This supports the hypothesis that expression of genetic risks is higher in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments. No indication was observed that the GRSBMIxSEP interaction was affected by other SEP-related factors included in the analysis.',\n",

Although children with ADHD exhibit more ODD and CD than non-ADHD youth, it is unknown if anxiety is associated with increased or decreased ODD and CD in children with ADHD. We examined parent and teacher ratings of ODD and CD from the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale in 203 school age children (ages 6-9); 70% were male, and 47% were Caucasian. Children were divided into four diagnostic groups based on ADHD and anxiety status from the Diagnostic Interview Scale for Children. According to parents, children with ADHD and anxiety had the highest levels of ODD/CD, followed by children with ADHD only (i.e., without anxiety). Children with anxiety only and controls had lowest ODD and CD scores, and these groups did not differ from each other. The same patterns were found according to teacher report, except that the anxiety only group had significantly lower levels of ODD than non-ADHD controls. Further, combined type ADHD youth with anxiety exhibited the highest levels of ODD and CD compared to all other groups.

The motivation, likewise is analyzed based on recent findings in the educational psychology field. Comparing the principles of topic work, with elements of motivation especially of intrinsic motivation, it will be concluded that topic work as methodology includes a lot of elements of intrinsic motivation.

At the concluding time, however, the structure is almost totally geostrophic. The initially uncorrelated geostrophic and ageostrophic portions of the SV separately evolve into highly correlated structures. These two separately evolved portions therefore reinforce each other, so that the sum of the concluding total perturbation energies of the two portions is less than the corresponding energy of the non-partitioned SV. The high correlations also suggest that the inverse of the tangent linear model would be ill-suited for estimating an initial perturbation given an imperfectly known final one.

       "  'abstract': 'This study took place in southern Quebec (Canada) where young stands of white ash and grey birch have been underplanted with white pine, red oak, bitternut hickory and black walnut. The establishment success of white pine and red oak was measured with and without tree shelters (to protect from deer). Ecological factors affecting the height growth of the four species were also measured for protected trees. After 6 years, the survival and total height of unprotected oak was 29% and 44.3 cm vs. 80.5% and 138.5 cm for protected oak. White pine was less affected by browsing (survival of 79.5 and 93.5%; height of 138.5 and 217.9 cm for unprotected vs. protected pine). Height of white pine was higher in the grey birch stands, while height of all hardwoods was higher in the white ash stands, which had better soil drainage, higher fertility, and an understory dominated by Rubus species. Total height of all hardwoods was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with Rubus cover and with soil fertility. Pine and walnut height were strongly correlated (p < 0.001) to shelterwood structure (canopy openness or total basal area). Pine was less sensitive to variations in shelterwood characteristics, while black walnut showed high sensitivity. This study provides evidence that underplanting is suitable for black walnut assisted migration northward and for bitternut hickory restoration, despite soil conditions that were less favorable than in bottomland habitats mainly supporting these species in eastern Canada. Tree shelters offering protection from deer browsing and species-specific site selection are recommended for underplanting in the southern Quebec region.',\n",

As wildfires become more frequent and severe with exotic annual grasses and climate change, it is unknown how BSCs will be affected. We examined the sites of four 12–16 year-old wildfires in Idaho, U.S.A. and adjacent unburned habitats. We found that several lichen and bryophyte species were more frequent and abundant in unburned plots but no species were significantly associated with burned plots. Burned BSC communities were largely a subset of unburned communities. We compared sampling methods using eight 1 m × 1 m subplots per plot to eight 0.25 m × 0.25 m microplots per plot. We observed 80 total taxa in the subplots, as compared with 68 in the microplots. However, even using the smaller sampling area, the difference in community composition between burned and unburned plots was evident. The number of observed taxa was unusually high for BSC studies in the area and may reflect our sampling in varied plant communities in four wildfire sites, unusually well-developed BSCs, larger plot sizes, or greater attention to taxonomic detail. These results add to our understanding of longer-term BSC community recovery following wildfires in the western United States.',\n",

The suppression experiment showed that in MSWI A thiourea could reduce the total I-TEQ value in flue gas by 73.4% from 1.41 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 to 0.37 I-TEQ/Nm3, those in fly ash by 87.1% from 14.3 ng I-TEQ/g to 1.84 I-TEQ/g and the total dioxins emission factor by 87.0 wt.%, with a (S + N)/Cl molar ratio of 9.4. The suppression efficiencies of PCDD/Fs in flue gas and fly ash in MSWI B could be up to 69.2% and 83.0% when the (S + N)/Cl molar ratio attained 7.51. Furthermore, the congener distributions of dioxins were also analysed in the flue gas and fly ash, before and after addition of thiourea, to find cues to some suppression mechanism. In addition, the filtered fly ash was explored by the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) analysis of fly ash. These results suggest that poisoning the metal catalyst and blocking the chlorination are most probably responsible for suppression.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) encodes a systemic signal communicating the perception of long day photoperiod from leaves to the shoot apex to induce the floral transition. Transient expression of FT in the phloem companion cells of rosette leaves for one to several days was previously shown to be sufficient to commit plants to flowering. Here we show that partial commitment results in pleiotropic inflorescence meristem reversion phenotypes. FT expression is much stronger in organs formed after the floral transition such as cauline leaves, sepals, and developing siliques. We show that expression of FT and its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) after the floral transition plays a role in inflorescence meristem stabilization even if plants flower very late in development. CONSTANS (CO), the major activator of FT, is not required to prevent late reproductive reversion. The requirement for FT is temporal since reproductive reversion to a vegetative state occurs only in recently formed inflorescence meristems. Unlike for the expression of FT in leaves, neither the distal putative FT enhancer nor long-day photoperiod is required for FT expression in developing siliques. Expression of FT in developing siliques and their supporting stems is sufficient to stabilize flowering during the sensitive developmental window indicating that fruit generated FT participates in inflorescence stabilization.',\n",

While high-fidelity pols have been well studied, much less is known about how some pols achieve medium or low fidelity with functional importance. Here we examine how human DNA polymerase λ (Pol λ) achieves medium fidelity by determining 12 crystal structures and performing pre-steady-state kinetic analyses. We showed that apo-Pol λ exists in the closed conformation, unprecedentedly with a preformed MgdNTP binding pocket, and binds MgdNTP readily in the active conformation in the absence of DNA. Since prebinding of MgdNTP could lead to very low fidelity as shown previously, it is attenuated in Pol λ by a hydrophobic core including Leu431, Ile492, and the Tyr505/Phe506 motif. We then predicted and demonstrated that L431A mutation enhances MgdNTP prebinding and lowers the fidelity. We also hypothesized that the MgdNTP-prebinding ability could stabilize a mismatched ternary complex and destabilize a matched ternary complex, and provided evidence with structures in both forms. Our results demonstrate that, while high-fidelity pols follow a common paradigm, Pol λ has developed specific conformations and mechanisms for its medium fidelity. Structural comparison with other pols also suggests that different pols likely utilize different conformational changes and microscopic mechanisms to achieve their catalytic functions with varying fidelities.',\n",

Group II is the negative control group only induced by DMBA 75 mg/kgBW; and group III ,IV , and V were treatment groups that treated by ethanolic extract of roselle calyx at dose of 10, 50 and 100 mg/kgBW/day for 7 days. After treatment with roselle, animals were induced by DMBA 75 mg/kgBW. On day 8 after DMBA induction, animals were fasted for 16 hours and blood was collected to measured SOD activity. Data were analyzed using One Way Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) and LSD (P <0.05). The result showed the significancies on increasing of SOD activity at 10 mg/kgBW (50.87±1.98), 50 mg/kgBW (69.98±3.58) and 100 mg/kgBW (73.01±6.95) compared with DMBA (43.74±1.95) (p<0,05).',\n",

The change in mixing shear rates allowed to notably modulating the fragmentation level for montmorillonite and the exfoliation level for modified montmorillonite. Barrier properties to nitrogen and water were altered with a reduction in PA12 chain mobility by confinement effect and geometrical constraints. Tortuosity effects induced by fillers were also highlighted. The water permeability and diffusivity were significantly decreased with exfoliated clays, while an increase was measured with an increased water solubility in presence of clay aggregates, both counterbalanced tortuosity effects. This trend was amplified when using low shear rates. According to filler used and mixing conditions, water sorption measurement has successfully demonstrated an increase in water solubility, due to filler affinity, which was surprisingly inconsistent with the change of water permeability. The occurrence of water plasticization phenomenon was also pointed out through the non-constant diffusivity, reflecting an increased free volume with water activity. Again, a decrease in water diffusivity was unexpectedly obtained, explained by tortuosity effects and ascribed to local water retention at the vicinity of clays, which creates water aggregates in films. These findings were also confirmed by a mathematical modeling approach of sorption process, discussing about the sorbed water access.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     In neighborhood rough set, radius is a key factor. Different radii may generate different neighborhood relations for discriminating samples. Unfortunately, it is possible that two samples with different labels are regarded as indistinguishable, mainly because the neighborhood relation does not always provide satisfactory discriminating performance. Moreover, it should be noticed that the process of obtaining reducts in terms of multiple different radii is very time-consuming, mainly because different radii imply different reducts and those reducts should be searched, respectively. To solve the above problems, not only a supervised neighborhood relation is proposed for obtaining better discriminating performance, but also an accelerator is designed to speed up the process of obtaining reducts. Firstly, both intra-class radius and inter-class radius are proposed to distinguish samples. Different from the previous approaches, the labels of samples are taken into account and then this is why our approach is referred to as the supervised neighborhood based strategy. Secondly, from the viewpoint of the variation of radius, an accelerator is designed which aims to quickly obtain multiple radii based reducts. Such mechanism is based on the consideration that the reduct in terms of the previous radius may guide the process of obtaining the reduct in terms of the current radius. The experimental results over 12 UCI data sets show the following: 1) compared with the traditional and pseudo-label neighborhood based reducts, our supervised neighborhood based reducts can provide higher classification accuracies; 2) our accelerator can significantly reduce the elapsed time for obtaining reducts. This study suggests new trends for considering neighborhood rough set related topics.',\n",

Overlapping symptomatology during first presentation challenges the diagnostic process. Reduced sleep spindle density (SSD) was suggested as a biomarker in adults, discerning patients with schizophrenia from patients with depression or healthy controls (HC). We aimed to compare SSD in early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), with MDD, and HC, and to analyse associations of SSD with symptomatology and neurocognitive measures.       Methods   Automatic sleep spindle detection was performed on all-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) data of 12 EOS, 19 MDD, and 57 HC (age range 9.8–19), allowing an age- and sex-matching of 1:2 (patients vs. HC). Severity of current symptoms and neurocognitive variables were assessed in all patients.       Results   SSD was defined between 13.75 and 14.50\\xa0Hz as within this frequency range SSD differed between EOS vs. HC in bin by bin analyses (12–15\\xa0Hz). In EOS, SSD was lower over 27 centro-temporal electrodes compared to HC and over 9 central electrodes compared to MDD. Reduced SSD in EOS compared to MDD and HC was accompanied by a high variability of SSD in all adolescents. SSD did not differ between MDD and HC. In the pooled sample of patients, lower SSD was associated with more severe Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale total score, more impaired memory consolidation and processing speed.       Conclusion   A high variability of SSD in all adolescents may reflect the evolving character of SSD. The association of reduced SSD with the symptom dimension of impaired cognition cuts across diagnostical entities.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     Traffic on Indian roads is highly mixed in nature with wide variations in the static and dynamic characteristics of vehicles. These vehicles do not follow strict lane discipline and occupy any available lateral position on the road space. Overtaking is one of the most complex and important manoeuvre on undivided roads where the vehicles use the opposing lane to overtake the slower vehicles with the presence of oncoming vehicles from opposite direction. They are unavoidable especially in the case of mixed traffic conditions where there is always a speed difference between the fast and slow moving vehicles. Overtaking process involves lane-changing manoeuvres, acceleration and deceleration actions and estimation of relative speed of overtaking and overtaken vehicles, and also, estimation of speed and distance of the oncoming vehicle. The main objective of the present study is to study the overtaking characteristics of vehicles on undivided roads under mixed traffic conditions. For this purpose, details of overtaking data were collected on a two-lane two-way undivided road using moving car observer method and registration plate method. The overtaking characteristics of all types of vehicles under mixed traffic conditions were observed and mathematically modelled.   The data extracted and analysed were the acceleration characteristics, speeds of the overtaking vehicles, overtaking time, overtaking distances, safe opposing gap required for overtaking, flow rates, overtaking frequencies, types of overtaking strategy, and types of overtaking and overtaken vehicles. Two types of overtaking strategies were observed in the field such as flying overtaking and accelerative overtaking. Graphs were plotted between the relative speed of the overtaking and overtaken vehicles against the overtaking time and negative correlation was found between the speed differential and total overtaking time for all categories of vehicles. It was observed that the number of overtaking increases with increase in the flow rate in the on-going direction and decreases with increase in flow in the opposite direction. The results obtained from this study will be useful to understand the overtaking behaviour of vehicles in mixed and non-lane discipline traffic conditions. These parameters will be useful in the development of traffic simulations models for undivided roads and thereby for estimation of capacity. The findings from the study can also be used to estimate potential collision times which will be helpful to improve the road safety.',\n",

A major step towards understanding neuronal function, therefore, is to identify the genes that encode different ionic currents. This study combined in situ patch clamp recordings of somatodendritic calcium currents in an identified adult Drosophila motoneuron with targeted genetic manipulation. Voltage clamp recordings revealed transient low voltage-activated (LVA) currents with activation between –60 mV and –70 mV as well as high voltage-activated (HVA) current with an activation voltage around –30 mV. LVA could be fully inactivated by prepulses to –50 mV and was partially amiloride sensitive. Recordings from newly generated mutant flies demonstrated that DmαG (Cav3 homolog) encoded the amiloride-sensitive portion of the transient LVA calcium current. We further demonstrated that the Cav2 homolog, Dmca1A, mediated the amiloride-insensitive component of LVA current. This novel role of Cav2 channels was substantiated by patch clamp recordings from conditional mutants, RNAi knock-downs, and following Dmca1A overexpression. In addition, we show that Dmca1A underlies the HVA somatodendritic calcium currents in vivo. Therefore, the Drosophila Cav2 homolog, Dmca1A, underlies HVA and LVA somatodendritic calcium currents in the same neuron. Interestingly, DmαG is required for regulating LVA and HVA derived from Dmca1A in vivo. In summary, each vertebrate gene family for voltage-gated calcium channels is represented by a single gene in Drosophila, namely Dmca1D (Cav1), Dmca1A (Cav2) and DmαG (Cav3), but the commonly held view that LVA calcium currents are usually mediated by Cav3 rather than Cav2 channels may require reconsideration.',\n",

Here, we use the Harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis, an invasive species which first established in the UK from continental Europe in 2004, to test whether records from 2004 and 2005 were associated with atmospheric events. We used the atmospheric- chemistry transport model SILAM to model the movement of this species from known distributions in continental Europe and tested whether the predicted atmospheric events were associated with the frequency of ladybird records in the UK. We show that the distribution of this species in the early years of its arrival does not provide substantial evidence for a purely anthropogenic introduction and show instead that atmospheric events can better explain this arrival event. Our results suggest that air flows which may assist dispersal over the English Channel are relatively frequent; ranging from once a week from Belgium and the Netherlands to 1–2 times a week from France over our study period.

For other land uses, like forestry, landscape effects are poorly known. We aimed to determine whether landscape composition modifies the response of saproxylic beetle species to local habitat and conservation management, with focus on dead wood and prescribed fire, in managed boreal forest landscapes. We surveyed beetles on 32 clearcuts in central Sweden. We measured local (fire, dead wood, flower resources, patch size) and landscape factors (fire, dead wood within 1–2\\xa0km\\xa0radius), and analysed interactions between these in mixed models. The response was species richness of beetles with different habitat specialization – conifer specialists, deciduous specialists, flower visitor and pyrophilous species, and abundance of a red-listed species, Tragosoma depsarium. Local and landscape factors, as well as interactions between them, affected species richness patterns. Prescribed fire and amount of dead wood, both on local and landscape scale, affected species richness and composition of several groups. There were interactions between local and landscape factors in five models out of six. Locally, we observed a positive response to flower richness for several groups, while the response to prescribed fire and dead wood amounts typically was affected by landscape factors. The results suggest that effectiveness of local conservation management is affected by landscape properties; the positive effects of local dead wood amounts and burning occurred on clearcuts in landscapes with large amounts of dead wood, but not in landscapes with small amounts of dead wood.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Milk lipid secretion is a critical process for the delivery of nutrition and energy from parent to offspring. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is less clear. Here we report that TDP-43, a RNA-binding protein, underwent positive selection in the mammalian lineage. Furthermore, TDP-43 gene (Tardbp) loss induces accumulation of large lipid droplets and severe lipid secretion deficiency in mammary epithelial cells to outside alveolar lumens, eventually resulting in lactation failure and pup starvation within three weeks postpartum. In human milk samples from lactating women, the expression levels of TDP-43 is positively correlated with higher milk output. Mechanistically, TDP-43 exerts post-transcriptional regulation of Btn1a1 and Xdh mRNA stability, which are required for the secretion of lipid droplets from epithelial cells to the lumen. Taken together, our results highlights the critical role of TDP-43 in milk lipid secretion, providing a potential strategy for the screening and intervention of clinical lactation insufficiency.',\n",

In a recent article, Ding et al demonstrate that prekallikrein depletion in mice followed by intranasal instillation of K. pneumoniae leads to a reduced bacterial burden and prolonged host survival, together with evidence of reduced distant organ damage. These effects are apparently independent of the role of prekallikrein in the contact system, and are associated with transcriptional changes relevant to innate immunity in the lung, established prior to infection. This study highlights the importance of further investigating the role of prekallikrein and other contact cascade components in host defence to counter K. pneumoniae (and perhaps other pathogens), with an overall aim of identifying potential therapeutic targets relevant to pulmonary infection with such resistant pathogens. © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     In this article, we propose an energy-aware load monitoring model, called e-Mon, for enabling energy-aware load balancing in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. P2P is a scalable and self-organizing technology for utilizing computational resources of the end-user devices for the benefit of a computing system. In P2P systems, the need for fair balance of load is crucial since the end-users need to be incentivized to participate in the system. The short battery life, caused by additional strain on the computational resources of the end-user devices, is a significant negative incentive factor for mobile end-users of current P2P systems. The e-Mon model, proposed in this article, enables moving load from energy-critical to less energy-critical nodes in P2P systems. This is done by including the energy status of a peer node as one of the factors defining a node’s load. The model helps saving the energy of mobile P2P nodes, particularly in cases when the remaining battery capacity is low. The article provides a thorough energy-efficiency evaluation demonstrating that e-Mon can significantly improve the battery life of mobile nodes by improving the quality and fairness of load balance between heterogeneous nodes. With a proper selection of a load balancing model for the application scenario, e-Mon is shown to achieve up to 470% battery life extension compared to the case with traditional load balancing with no battery monitoring.',\n",

Unfortunately, the total area of these landscapes was dramatically reduced in the course of the second half of the 20th century. In our study, we focus on the development of 38 fragments of medieval hedgerow-defined field patterns in Czechia referred to as   pluzina , in an attempt to reveal significant determinants of their persistence or disappearance between 1996 and 2016. Using patch-scale spatial data generated from GIS, mixed-effect modelling was performed to test for the effects of five local drivers and their first-order interactions in explaining the variation of the preservation rate of these features. The study reveals a trend towards a slight decrease in the total area of these valuable field patterns. However, the trends vary greatly from area to area. This reflects not only the influence of natural determinants but also a significant effect of land-use policy measures in individual areas over the study period.   Our findings confirm that land-use planning measures are the most important factor: grassland is more likely to be preserved, while cropland tends to lead to a reduction in or destruction of valuable patterns. The second most powerful factor was land tenure security. While areas of historic structures managed predominantly by owner-operators were able to grow in size over the period of our study, areas managed by tenant-operators were reduced in size. Legal restrictions in the area of nature conservation were another statistically significant driver and determinant that had a positive effect on the preservation of historic landscapes. It has also been shown that   pluzina   landscapes are more likely to be preserved or enlarged in less fertile areas. In conclusion, our findings have confirmed the crucial effect of individual land-use policy measures on individual sites, where appropriately chosen measures, such as sensitive planning, restrictions and incentives, were the principal drivers of the preservation of rural landscapes.',\n",

In this work, we first studied the binding and intracellular fate of the monoclonal antibody MC-813-70 directed against SSEA-4.

Mature spores are monomorphic, ellipsoidal with an average size of 5(4-6) μm in length and 2.2 (2-3) μm in width.

       "  'abstract': 'It is essential for social interactions if one can process the perceived external world with appropriate cognitive control and well-regulated emotion. However, compared with healthy individuals, patients with major depression disorder (MDD) usually exhibit compromised cognitive and enhanced emotional processes, respectively; and these behavioral changes have been shown to be associated with alterations in functional brain networks. Recent advances of MDD research have been increasingly involving functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and focusing on brain networks of cognition and emotion, as well as the interaction of these two networks. While inconsistencies and debates noted, the present paper attempts to review and provide a summarized finding for these recent fMRI studies. Converging results have shown that MDD is associated with significant alterations in the fronto-limbic system. Specifically, compared with healthy controls, individuals with MDD usually show hyperactivation to negative facial stimuli in the amygdala, reflecting increased withdrawal, the core syndrome of depression. Some studies have also attempted to use hyperactivities of amygdala as the biomarker and reported its predictive value for MDD. Besides amygdala, increased insula response to disgusting faces was also reported in literature, emphasizing the role of disgust in emotional dysregulation. Cognitive abnormalities in depression mainly concern the default mode and executive control networks. In addition to alterations of regional activation in task state, individuals with MDD exhibit increased functional connectivity of the default mode network in resting state, suggesting enhanced self-referential processes. In particular, higher functional connectivity in the anterior default mode network corresponds with higher level of rumination. In the executive control network, many previous studies observed a decreased activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression, indicating impaired ability of cognitive control. At the same time, recent research found that transcranial direct current stimulation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was helpful for working memory enhancement in individuals with MDD. While alterations were reported in the emotional and cognitive networks separately, interactive changes of these 2 modules have also been examined when they are simultaneously probed. Most studies have noted that when challenged with negative emotion, individuals with depression show increased activation in amygdala and decreased activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, indicating a biased processing resource allocation towards the emotional system. Based on the aforementioned fMRI studies of MDD, we suggest that future improvements may consider aspects of (i) matching depressive syndromes for optimized confounding factor control; (ii) incorporating multimodal approaches for both brain imaging and stimulation; as well as (iii) applying neuroimaging together with psychological therapies either for prognosis evaluation or neurofeedback training.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Head-mounted displays (HMDs) often cause discomfort and even nausea. Improving comfort is therefore one of the most significant challenges for the design of such systems. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of different HMD display configurations on discomfort. We do this by designing a device to measure human visual behavior and evaluate viewer comfort. In particular, we focus on one known source of discomfort: the vergence-accommodation (VA) conflict. The VA conflict is the difference between accommodative and vergence response. In HMDs the eyes accommodate to a fixed screen distance while they converge to the simulated distance of the object of interest, requiring the viewer to undo the neural coupling between the two responses. Several methods have been proposed to alleviate the VA conflict, including Depth-of-Field (DoF) rendering, focus-adjustable lenses, and monovision. However, no previous work has investigated whether these solutions actually drive accommodation to the distance of the simulated object. If they did, the VA conflict would disappear, and we expect comfort to improve. We design the first device that allows us to measure accommodation in HMDs, and we use it to obtain accommodation measurements and to conduct a discomfort study. The results of the first experiment demonstrate that only the focus-adjustable-lens design drives accommodation effectively, while other solutions do not drive accommodation to the simulated distance and thus do not resolve the VA conflict. The second experiment measures discomfort. The results validate that the focus-adjustable-lens design improves comfort significantly more than the other solutions.',\n",

Yet, despite persistent tendencies to anthropomorphize states, most International Relations scholarship implicitly adopts the position that humans are conscious and states are not. Recognizing that scholarly disagreement over fundamental issues prevents answering definitively whether states are truly conscious, I instead demonstrate how scholars of multiple dispositions can incorporate a pragmatic notion of state consciousness into their theorizing. Drawing on recent work from Eric Schwitzgebel and original supplementary arguments, I demonstrate that states are not only complex informationally integrated systems with emergent properties, but they also exhibit seemingly genuine responses to qualia that are irreducible to individuals within them. Though knowing whether states possess an emergent ‘stream’ of consciousness indiscernible to their inhabitants may not yet be possible, I argue that a pragmatic notion of state consciousness can contribute to a more complete understanding of state personhood, as well as a revised model of the international system useful to multiple important theoretical debates. In the article's final section, I apply this model to debate over the levels of analysis at which scholarship applies ontological security theory. I suggest the possibility of emergent state-level ontological insecurity that need not be understood via problematic reduction to individuals.\",\n",

The consequence of this is suboptimal cell designs because cell manufacturers do not have a metric to optimise. The Cell Cooling Coefficient for pouch cell tab cooling (CCC tabs ) defines a cell's capability to reject heat from its tabs. However, surface cooling remains the thermal management approach of choice for automotive and other high-power applications. This study introduces a surface Cell Cooling Coefficient, CCC surf which is shown to be a fundamental property of a lithium-ion cell. CCC surf is found to be considerably larger than CCC tabs , and this is a trend anticipated for every pouch cell currently commercially available. However, surface cooling induces layer-to-layer nonuniformity which is strongly linked to reduced cell performance and reduced cell lifetime. Thus, the Cell Cooling Coefficient enables quantitative comparison of each cooling method. Further, a method is presented for using the Cell Cooling Coefficients to inform the optimal design of a battery pack thermal management system. In this manner, implementation of the Cell Cooling Coefficient can transform the industry, by minimising the requirement for computationally expensive modelling or time consuming experiments in the early stages of battery-pack design.\",\n",

A partir de alli, se intenta mostrar como este distanciamiento de Honneth habilita una nueva forma –aunque no explorada por el autor- de conceptualizar el caracter y rol de la sociedad civil.   This article provides an analysis of Honneth’s objection to Habermas’s distinction between System and Lebenswelt. Honneth postulates it’s a theorical fiction that leads to misunderstand social dynamics and weakens his communicative perspective. Honneth’s objection is linked to other critical reviews of the distinction, and I conclude its relevance, also considering Habermas’s reply. From there, I try to show how Honneth objection opens a new way to think about civil society.',\n",

The effects of starting powders on grain growth and densification during sintering of ceramics were revealed. Two distinct pressureless sintering methods were investigated, including conventional and two-step sintering. The sample grain size increases abruptly as sintering temperature increases during conventional sintering. In contrast, in two-step sintering, abnormal or discontinuous grain growth was suppressed in the second step, leading to Gd2Zr2O7 nanoceramics formation (average grain size 83\\xa0nm, relative density\\u2009∼93%). Such distinct behaviors may originate from the interplay between kinetic factors such as grain boundary migration and diffusion. Moreover, suppression of grain growth and promotion of densification in the two-step sintering are mainly due to dominant role of grain boundary diffusion during the second-step sintering process.',\n",

The aim was to transparently report the development of a smartphone app designed to aid smoking cessation during pregnancy. The development of a smartphone app ('SmokeFree Baby') to help pregnant women stop smoking was guided by frameworks for developing complex interventions, including the Medical Research Council (MRC), Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Two integrative behaviour change theories provided the theoretical base. Evidence from the scientific literature and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) from the BCT Taxonomy v1 informed the intervention content. The app was developed around five core modules, each with a distinct intervention target (identity change, stress management, health information, promoting use of face-to-face support and behavioural substitution) and available in a 'control' or 'full' version. SmokeFree Baby has been developed as part of a multiphase intervention optimization to identify the optimum combination of intervention components to include in smartphone apps to help pregnant smokers stop smoking.\",\n",

Unlike commodity cash crops, however, there has been relatively little cover crop breeding research and development. We conducted an online survey to evaluate: (a) the perspectives of organic and conventional farmers in the USA who use cover crops and (b) the specific cover crop traits that are important to farmers. We recruited participants from both organic and conventional agriculture networks and 69% of respondents reported that they farmed organic land. In addition to demographic data and information on management practices, we quantified farmer perspectives on four winter annual cover crops: (1) Austrian winter pea, (2) crimson clover, (3) hairy vetch and (4) cereal rye. Overall, respondents represented a wide range of states, farm sizes, plant hardiness zones and cash crops produced. Of the 417 full responses received, 87% of respondents reported that they used cover crops. The maximum amount farmers were willing to spend on cover crop seed varied by farmer type: 1% of conventional farmers versus 19% of organic farmers were willing to spend over US75 acre−1). Organic and conventional farmers differed in terms of the reasons why they grew cover crops, with organic farmers placing greater value on the ecosystem services from cover crops. More organic (63%) than conventional (51%) farmers agreed that participatory breeding was important for cover crop variety development (P = 0.047). Both groups shared strong support for cover crop research and considered many of the same traits to be important for breeding. For the legume cover crops, nitrogen fixation was considered the most important trait, whereas winter hardiness, early vigor, biomass production and weed suppression were the most important traits for cereal rye. Our results illustrate common interests as well as differences in the perspectives between organic and conventional farmers on cover crops and can be used to inform nascent cover crop breeding efforts.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     The paper deals with the evaluation of the efficacy of both ammonium polyphosphate, APP, and alkaline lignin, AL, as suitable additives for the development of innovative and sustainable composites based on thermo-plasticized zein, TPZ. The chemical and physical interactions which occur between AL and APP and the secondary structure of thermo-plasticized zein were investigated by torque analysis and FTIR spectroscopy and were exploited to rationalize macroscopic properties such as the thermal stability, fire behavior and the mechanical properties. In details the fire behavior of the composites was evaluated by both cone calorimetry and self-sustained vertical combustion tests in order to simulate different fire scenario. The results highlighted that AL intercalates both the   α -helix and   β -sheets structures and thus improves the fire retardant behavior of composites in the vertical burning scenario by enabling the withdrawal effect of the film from flame due to the removal of PEG plasticizer during the burning test.   On the other side, APP enhances the fire resistance of composites exposed to pool forced combustion due to an enhanced charring effect which protects the substrate during burning. Finally the composite containing simultaneously 10\\xa0wt% APP and 3\\xa0wt% AL exhibited excellent fire resistance behavior in different fire scenario and satisfying mechanical properties with a toughness which is around 30% higher than that of pristine TPZ. Due to this peculiar combination of functional and structural properties the composite materials may be considered as potential substitutes of traditional polymeric materials in several application fields (i.e packaging, electrical components, …).',\n",

To improve the accuracy of the AMIRA P9 flotation model in predicting flotation rate constant (k) and to improve the consistency of ore property, measurable and appropriate turbulence parameters were sought to be incorporated into the model. Therefore, two dimensionless turbulence parameters ae and EVF, derived from practical measurements, were formulated and introduced to the AMIRA P9 model.

However, an irregular indenter tip shape will significantly change the stress distribution, and therefore the maximum shear stress from a Hertzian estimation. Here, we assess possible errors and pitfalls of the Hertzian estimation of initial plastic yield at the nanoscale. The near-apex shapes of two Berkovich indenters, one sharp and one worn, were measured by atomic force microscopy and directly input into finite element analysis (FEA) models for “virtual” nanoindentation experiments on single-crystal tungsten. Experiments were also carried out with those indenters. Excellent agreement is found between experimental and FEA force–displacement relationships, but the discrepancies between Hertzian and FEA estimates of the shear stresses are over 25% for the sharp indenter and over 50% for the blunt indenter. This demonstrates that small irregularities in the shape of indenter tips can cause significant deviations from the Hertzian estimation of dislocation nucleation stress.',\n",

Despite these sensory properties, the data regarding menthol’s effect on smoking topography are inconsistent.

       "  'abstract': 'De novo formation of cells in the Drosophila embryo is achieved when each nucleus is surrounded by a furrow of plasma membrane. Remodeling of the plasma membrane during cleavage furrow ingression involves the exocytic and endocytic pathways, including endocytic tubules that form at cleavage furrow tips (CFT-tubules). The tubules are marked by amphiphysin but are otherwise poorly understood. Here we identify the septin family of GTPases as new tubule markers. Septins do not decorate CFT-tubules homogeneously: instead, novel septin complexes decorate different CFT-tubules or different domains of the same CFT-tubule. Using these new tubule markers, we determine that all CFT-tubule formation requires the BAR domain of amphiphysin. In contrast, dynamin activity is preferentially required for the formation of the subset of CFT-tubules containing the septin Peanut. The absence of tubules in amphiphysin-null embryos correlates with faster cleavage furrow ingression rates. In contrast, upon inhibition of dynamin, longer tubules formed, which correlated with slower cleavage furrow ingression rates. These data suggest that regulating the recycling of membrane within the embryo is important in supporting timely furrow ingression.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract   We validate the performance of three   P ‐velocity models built with different approaches on regional travel‐time prediction for the Tethyan margin in order to test how well they predict independently observed travel times. The three models are constructed with travel‐time tomography, a compilation of   a priori   geologic and geophysical information, and empirical scaling with adjustment from   P ‐arrival inversion, respectively. We compared the synthetics with reference travel times (ground truth data) obtained by using events or explosions located within 25\\xa0km with 95% confidence. We found variance of travel times is not an adequate tool to assess the performance of velocity models, because predicted travel times that have small variance can have very different mean value from that of observed ones. Therefore, we propose an alternative way, variance estimation with mean of observed travel times (zero mean). This technique is more efficient to assess the mismatch between synthetics and observed travel times. Among the three models we investigated, the EAPV11 model built mainly with the empirical scaling shows better performance on the travel‐time prediction. This result is intriguing, because this model inherits crustal velocity structure, Moho depth,   Pn   velocities, and upper‐mantle structure that affects travel times at regional distance, mostly from a scaled 3D   S ‐velocity model for the same region. This fact may imply that although errors may be included in this scaling, this way would work better than conventional   P ‐arrival inversion. This difference likely exists because surface waves have a better lateral resolution for the crust and uppermost mantle than travel times.

       "  'abstract': 'A trade-off between survival to sexual maturity and mating success is common across alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs), and can lead to tactical disruptive selection on shared traits (i.e. positive selection gradient in one tactic, and negative selection gradient in another). We were interested in examining the theoretical possibility of tactical disruptive selection on intrinsic growth rate. The male ARTs in Xiphophorus multilineatus express two distinct life histories: “courters” optimize mating success by maturing later at larger size and coaxing females to mate, while “sneakers” optimize survival to sexual maturity by maturing earlier at a smaller size, using both coaxing and coercive mating behaviors. In addition to differences in mating behaviors, body length, body depth, and the pigment pattern vertical bars, courter males grow faster than sneaker males. We present a new hypothesis for differences in growth rates between genetically influenced ARTs. The “growth-maturity optimization” hypothesis suggests that ARTs with differences in the probability of surviving to sexual maturity may have different optimal growth rates, leading to tactical disruptive selection. We also present a simple model to suggest that when considering both a cost and benefit to faster growth, tactical disruptive selection on growth rates is theoretically possible. In our model, the value that determines when tactical disruptive selection on growth rate will occur is the increase in probability of survival to sexual maturity gained through faster growth multiplied by the cost of faster growth (reduced longevity). Finally, we present empirical evidence to support the prediction that faster growth has a cost in X. multilineatus: in a controlled laboratory setting, courter males that did not survive 1.2\\xa0years past sexual maturity grew faster as juveniles (14–70\\xa0days) than those that survived.',\n",

The data analysis shows that the distribution of the lift coefficient depending on the blockage ratio plays an important role in such a system. A further study of the case of two side-by-side identical cylinders demonstrates the existence of two distinct cooperative vibrations of the cylinders, e.g., in-phase-synchronized vibration (IPSV) and anti-phase-synchronized vibration (APSV).

These functional DNA and RNA sequences can be identified from random-sequence pools by in vitro selection, which requires choosing the length of the random region. Shorter random regions allow more complete coverage of sequence space but may not permit the structural complexity necessary for binding or catalysis. In contrast, longer random regions are sampled incompletely but may allow adoption of more complicated structures that enable function. In this study, we systematically examined random region length (N(20) through N(60)) for two particular deoxyribozyme catalytic activities, DNA cleavage and tyrosine-RNA nucleopeptide linkage formation. For both activities, we previously identified deoxyribozymes using only N(40) regions. In the case of DNA cleavage, here we found that shorter N(20) and N(30) regions allowed robust catalytic function, either by DNA hydrolysis or by DNA deglycosylation and strand scission via β-elimination, whereas longer N(50) and N(60) regions did not lead to catalytically active DNA sequences. Follow-up selections with N(20), N(30), and N(40) regions revealed an interesting interplay of metal ion cofactors and random region length. Separately, for Tyr-RNA linkage formation, N(30) and N(60) regions provided catalytically active sequences, whereas N(20) was unsuccessful, and the N(40) deoxyribozymes were functionally superior (in terms of rate and yield) to N(30) and N(60). Collectively, the results indicate that with future in vitro selection experiments for DNA and RNA catalysts, and by extension for aptamers, random region length should be an important experimental variable.',\n",

Triclosan (TCS) was used as a model drug. C974, at concentrations ranging between 2% and 4%, was dispersed in 25\\xa0ml of PEG 400, and the dispersion was homogenised for 5\\xa0min at 24,000\\xa0rpm. The dispersion was either heated at 80°C in water bath under mechanic stirring at 200\\xa0rpm or exposed to micro-irradiation (1,200\\xa0W/1\\xa0h) for 2\\xa0min. The formulations prepared with both methods performed a well-structured gel matrix characteristic at 3% and 4% of C974 concentrations. As the concentrations of the polymer increased, the elastic properties also increased. The viscosity profiles indicated a shear-thinning system. DSC data revealed that TCS was dissolved in gel. Skin accumulation ability of TCS had been improved by these novel organogels regardless of the preparation method. TCS was still microbiologically effective after the microwave process was applied. It was determined that microwave heating is a suitable method to obtain C974 organogels. This novel production technique developed might be promising especially in industrial scale when the dramatic reduction in the preparation time and energy were considered.',\n",

Methods   A prospective study was conducted on 400 pregnant patients to determine the fetal sex by ultrasound scan between 11–13+6\\xa0weeks of gestation. A midsagittal plane of the fetus was obtained by two sonographers who were newly trained for measuring nuchal translucency. It would be assigned as male if the fetal phallus was in the cranial direction and assigned as female if in caudal direction. The baby sex was confirmed after delivery. The accuracy of each sonographer was analyzed after every 50 ultrasound scans performed.   Results   Nearly all the patients requested to be informed about the fetal sex during ultrasound. The accuracy in determining fetal sex by the two sonographers increased with the number of ultrasound scans performed. The two sonographers achieved an accuracy rate of 71.4–78% after 200 ultrasound scans performed. Among different factors which may affect the accuracy in determining fetal sex with ultrasound, a gestational age less than 12\\xa0weeks had a significantly lower accuracy than those more than 12\\xa0weeks, and male fetuses had significantly higher accuracy than female fetuses.

       "  'abstract': 'HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the mainstay in the pharmacologic management of dyslipidemia. Since they are widely prescribed, their safety remains an issue of concern. Rosuvastatin has been proven to be efficacious in improving serum lipid profiles. Recently published data from the JUPITER study confirmed the efficacy of this statin in primary prevention for older patients with multiple risk factors and evidence of inflammation. Rosuvastatin exhibits high hydrophilicity and hepatoselectivity, as well as low systemic bioavailability, while undergoing minimal metabolism via the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, rosuvastatin has an interesting pharmacokinetic profile that is different from that of other statins. However, it remains to be established whether this may translate into a better safety profile and fewer drug-drug interactions for this statin compared with others. Herein, we review evidence with regard to the safety of this statin as well as its interactions with agents commonly prescribed in the clinical setting. As with other statins, rosuvastatin treatment is associated with relatively low rates of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure. Asymptomatic liver enzyme elevations occur with rosuvastatin at a similarly low incidence as with other statins. Rosuvastatin treatment has also been associated with adverse effects related to the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, which are also commonly observed with many other drugs. Proteinuria induced by rosuvastatin is likely to be associated with a statin-provoked inhibition of low-molecular-weight protein reabsorption by the renal tubules. Higher doses of rosuvastatin have been associated with cases of renal failure. Also, the co-administration of rosuvastatin with drugs that increase rosuvastatin blood levels may be deleterious for the kidney. Furthermore, rhabdomyolysis, considered a class effect of statins, is known to involve renal damage. Concerns have been raised by findings from the JUPITER study suggesting that rosuvastatin may slightly increase the incidence of physician-reported diabetes mellitus, as well as the levels of glycated hemoglobin in older patients with multiple risk factors and low-grade inflammation. Clinical trials proposed no increase in the incidence of neoplasias with rosuvastatin treatment compared with placebo. Drugs that antagonize organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin are more likely to interact with this statin. Clinicians should be cautious when rosuvastatin is co-administered with vitamin K antagonists, cyclosporine (ciclosporin), gemfibrozil, and antiretroviral agents since a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with those drugs may increase the risk of toxicity. On the other hand, rosuvastatin combination treatment with fenofibrate, ezetimibe, omega-3-fatty acids, antifungal azoles, rifampin (rifampicin), or clopidogrel seems to be safe, as there is no evidence to support any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction of rosuvastatin with any of these drugs. Rosuvastatin therefore appears to be relatively safe and well tolerated, sharing the adverse effects that are considered class effects of statins. Practitioners of all medical practices should be alert when rosuvastatin is prescribed concomitantly with agents that may increase the risk of rosuvastatin-associated toxicity.',\n",

In this article, I draw on 18 months of research with Nicaraguan community health workers (brigadistas) for whom mosquito abatement involved an opening, rather than a closing, of the landscape. Brigadistas, especially female brigadistas, took deep pleasure in learning about mosquito–human lifeworlds, a pleasure I call “ecological aesthetic.” Ecological aesthetics—patterns of connection that are identifiable only through performance—contrasted to the more familiar aesthetics identifiable in the ministry's ordering of the household.

Materials and methods: While discussing this case we have analysed different reasons why the studied fisherman could not be successfully treated on board. Results: A 42-year-old fisherman was first presented with skin lesions while fishing for hake. When the fisherman had developed a fever and exfoliative skin lesions on both hands, the ship’s captain called the radio-medical centre for the maritime consultation in Toulouse and for the advice on treatment. After 3 days on penicillin, the fever decreased, but the dermatitis became incapacitating. On his return to shore, the fisherman was hospitalised. Bacteriological swabs of the skin lesion showed colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus methi-S with presence of Panton Valentine leukocidin. Seven-day treatment with a follow-up of antibioticotherapy was necessary to resolve the skin eruption and obtain definitive apyrexia. Treatment ashore was advised because of difficulty in continuing manual work on board whilst suffering from significant skin lesions and also due to fear of contagion. Conclusions: Skin infection with Staphylococcus aureus methi-S with presence of Panton Valentine leukocidin is difficult to treat on board because of difficulty in carrying out manual work when hands are affected, and also due to slow improvement of dermatitis even when appropriate treatment is undergone. The maritime environment is also a risk factor for skin abrasion, which can lead to secondary colonisation of pathogenic bacteria. (Int Marit Health 2013; 64, 3: 126–128)',\n",

Despite the central role of these amino acids in energy transduction and catalysis, the determinants of their unusual properties are difficult to reproduce with computational approaches. Conformational reorganization of the protein backbone is a key determinant of pKa values. This reflects the ability of the protein to sample conformational microstates, which is particularly challenging to reproduce computationally. To characterize structural details and timescales of conformational reorganization coupled to ionization of buried groups, NMR spectroscopy was used to identify locations, measure timescales, and determine the extent of pH dependence of conformational exchange in the L25K and L125K variants of staphylococcal nuclease. Lys-25 or Lys-125 titrate with pKa values of 6.3 and 6.2, respectively. Using relaxation dispersion spectroscopy we observed that the β barrel of the L25K protein fluctuates between the native and an alternate state on the 0.4 to 7 ms timescale. The HN chemical shifts of the alternate state, assigned using ZZ-exchange spectroscopy, were less dispersed than those of the native state, consistent with unfolding of the β barrel. The equilibrium between these states is strongly pH dependent, with the partially unfolded state dominating at pH values at which the internal Lys residue is charged. In contrast, the L125K protein exhibited fluctuations near Lys-125 on the µs-ms timescale but in a faster regime than the L25K protein and without pH dependence. These results show the extent of coupling between conformational change and proton binding is highly dependent on local structural properties. Computational models attempting to reproduce the properties and pKa values of buried ionizable groups must be able to represent conformational exchange between native and subglobally unfolded states on ms timescales.',\n",

The NPS also is an autocrine/paracrine neurohormonal system that enhances lusitropy, opposes cardiac hypertrophy, and retards the development of cardiac interstitial fibrosis (Figure 1).1 Tsutomota and colleagues2 were among the first to advance the concept that advanced heart failure was associated with an “attenuation of the compensatory actions” of the NPS. Using plasma cGMP levels as a surrogate biomarker for the target tissue actions of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), they demonstrated that in advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association class III/IV) compared to mild heart failure (class I/II), there was a reduction of the slope of the relationship between plasma ANP levels and cGMP levels; in fact, despite a nearly 4-fold higher average ANP level in patients with advanced heart failure compared to mild heart failure, plasma cGMP levels were similar.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract     We investigate the effects of varying Saturn’s orbit on the atmospheric circulation and surface methane distribution of Titan. Using a new general circulation model of Titan’s atmosphere, we simulate its climate under four characteristic configurations of orbital parameters that correspond to snapshots over the past 42\\xa0kyr, capturing the amplitude range of long-period cyclic variations in eccentricity and longitude of perihelion. The model, which covers pressures from the surface to 0.5\\xa0mbar, reproduces the present-day temperature profile and tropospheric superrotation. In all four simulations, the atmosphere efficiently transports methane poleward, drying out the low- and mid-latitudes, indicating that these regions have been desert-like for at least tens of thousands of years. Though circulation patterns are not significantly different, the amount of surface methane that builds up over either pole strongly depends on the insolation distribution; in the present-day, methane builds up preferentially in the north, in agreement with observations, where summer is milder but longer. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for the configuration 14\\xa0kyr ago, while the south pole gains more methane in the case for 28\\xa0kyr ago, and the system is almost symmetric 42\\xa0kyr ago. This confirms the hypothesis that orbital forcing influences the distribution of surface liquids, and that the current observed asymmetry could have been partially or fully reversed in the past. The evolution of the orbital forcing implies that the surface reservoir is transported on timescales of ∼30\\xa0kyr, in which case the asymmetry reverses with a period of ∼125\\xa0kyr. Otherwise, the orbital forcing does not produce a net asymmetry over longer timescales, and is not a likely mechanism for generating the observed dichotomy.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The G20’s renewal of faith in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the 2008 financial crisis appears to have reversed the IMF’s declining relevance evident in the years preceding the crisis. This article examines this putative revival of the IMF, arguing that the G20’s actions contained a paradox of delegation. On the one hand, the nature of the G20’s replenishment of the IMF’s resources during the crisis (mostly through credit lines available to the IMF) as well as the independence the major G20 economies can afford to have from the IMF (given that they are not beholden to its resources) has meant that the G20 countries faced low sovereignty costs in reviving the IMF. On the other hand, truly re-establishing the IMF’s relevance would impose higher sovereignty costs, specifically in the form of strengthened IMF surveillance over G20 economies. This paradox of delegation suggests that the G20’s action toward the IMF does not inform properly whether the G20 states have contemplated the trade-off between suffering sovereignty costs and achieving gains from delegation. In this regard, the proper role of the IMF in the governance of the global economy remains uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicy Implications\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\r\\n\\u2002The G20’s resuscitation of the IMF cannot be simply interpreted as indicating certainty regarding the future of the institution.\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\r\\n\\u2002In order for the IMF to fulfill its key tasks, particularly surveillance of global economic conditions, as envisioned by key members of the G20, these states need to permit the IMF to play the role of a mediator and technical expert in close coordination of their policies.\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\r\\n\\u2002The G20 states should resist the temptation to forum shop, namely charge other institutions with tasks similar to those of the IMF with a view to dispersing/avoiding sovereignty costs.\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\r\\n\\u2002It is no longer viable to hold on to prior assumptions and frameworks regarding the distribution of influence among states vis-a-vis the IMF – scholarly and policy works need to recognize large emerging economies as key principals of the Fund.\\r\\n\\r\\n•\\r\\n\\u2002At the same time, the IMF needs to enhance the evenhandedness of its analysis and advice in order to increase key member states’ perceptions of its effectiveness and fairness.',\n",

Higher intakes of fiber are linked to lower body weights.

Objective: To study the antibacterial, antioxidant activities, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of Hopea ponga leaf, extracted from different solvents viz., petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol. Materials and Methods: Antibacterial activity of leaf extract of Hopea ponga was determined by disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were assayed through in‑vitro models such as 2,2‑diphenyl‑1‑picrylhydrazyl, 2,2’‑azino‑bis (3‑ethylbenzothiazoline‑6‑sulphonic acid), ferric reducing antioxidant power, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl scavenging activities. Total flavonoid content was determined using aluminium chloride colorimetric method and total phenolic content determined using Folin ciocaulteu reagent method. Results: Methanol extract showed higher scavenging activity against 2,2‑diphenyl‑1‑picrylhydrazyl and reducing power activity against ferric ion (97.24 ± 0.11 and 88.01 ± 0.03) compared to other extracts.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with suspected lung malignancy underwent whole-body FDG PET/CT at 1, 2, and 3 hours after an IV injection of F-FDG. The SUVs of FDG in lung nodules and hilar/mediastinal nodes at each time point were correlated with biopsy/surgical pathologic findings. RESULTS There were a total of 45 malignant lesions and 80 benign lesions from 43 patients with pathologic diagnosis that were included for analysis. The SUVmax had an average of 25.5% increase in all tumor-positive lesions from 1 to 2 hours (vs 1.6% decrease in all tumor-negative lesions, P < 0.0001) and an average of 39.1% increase from 1 to 3 hours (vs 4.5% increase in all tumor-negative lesions, P < 0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the 2-hour and 3-hour SUVmax had similar area under the curve and outperformed the SUVmax on the 1-hour initial imaging or retention index (RI). The optimal cutoff values to differentiate malignancy from benign lesions were 3.24 for 1-hour SUVmax, 3.67 for 2-hour SUVmax, and 4.21 for 3-hour SUVmax, with 11.6% for 1- to 2-hour RI and 23.9% for 1- to 3-hour RI. The 3-hour delayed SUVmax of 4.21 provided the best overall performance (accuracy of 88.8%). The analysis of the lesion-to-background ratio revealed that delayed imaging improved the image quality significantly, leading to much easier detection of either malignant or benign lesions. CONCLUSIONS Multiple time point FDG PET/CT imaging moderately improves the diagnostic accuracy of lung cancer and significantly improves the image quality.',\n",

In the original presentation of the DMM, the materials comprising the interface were described as Debye solids. Such a treatment, while accurate in the low temperature regime for which the model was originally intended, is less accurate at higher temperatures. Here, the DMM is reformulated such that, in place of Debye dispersion, the materials on either side of the interface are described by an isotropic dispersion obtained from exact phonon dispersion diagrams in the [100] crystallographic direction. This reformulated model is applied to three interfaces of interest: Cr–Si, Cu–Ge, and Ge–Si. It is found that Debye dispersion leads to substantially higher predictions of thermal boundary conductance. Additionally, it is shown that optical phonons play a significant role in interfacial thermal transport, a notion not previously explored. Lastly, the role of the assumed dispersion is more broadly explored for Cu–Ge interfaces. The prediction of thermal boundary conductance via the DMM with the assumed isotropic [100] dispersion relationships is compared to predictions with isotropic [111] and exact three-dimensional phonon dispersion relationships. It is found that regardless of the chosen crystallographic direction, the predictions of thermal boundary conductance using isotropic phonon dispersion relationships are within a factor of two of those predictions using an exact three-dimensional phonon dispersion.',\n",

When 6 week old rats were fed a low NaCl diet (n=7-11/group), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urinary albumin (UAlb) excretion were not significantly different in grain-fed rats compared to values in casein-fed rats (107±2 mmHg and 6±2 mg/day). Increasing dietary NaCl intake to 4.0% for three weeks led to a significantly greater increase in MAP (171±7 vs 119±7 mmHg), UAlb (164±19 vs 24±6 mg/day) and renal histological damage in SS rats fed the casein diet (p<.05). To assess mechanisms of this NaCl independent effect, an RNA-Seq analysis of renal outer medullary tissue of rats (n=4/group) fed the grain- or casein-based diets was performed. Over 1500 known genes were differentially expressed between the casein- and grain-fed rats on low salt; over 2100 were different between the groups fed the 4.0% chow (FDR<0.05); and 897 genes were common to these two data sets. The differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched for genes related to hematopoietic cell lineage, the complement and coagulation cascade, B-cell signaling, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and primary immunodeficiency. To understand potential mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression, a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of the renal outer medulla at single-base resolution was performed. Of nearly 3,000 methylated CpG islands identified, 534 and 650 were differentially methylated between the casein and grain fed groups when comparing effects of low to high salt diets, respectively (FDR<0.05). Approximately 200 differentially methylated CpG islands were located in the proximity of transcriptional start sites. We first focused our attention on several genes which exhibited a reciprocal pattern of DNA methylation and RNA abundance. These include Klotho (an aging-related gene), and Cyp39a1 (a cytochrome P450) which exhibited significantly more 5-methylcytosine modifications in the transcription start site and reduced mRNA expression in rats fed the casein-based diet with low salt. These data provide evidence that epigenetic modifications due to NaCl-independent dietary effects may alter salt-sensitive blood pressure and renal disease phenotypes.',\n",

The lessons of four lesson periods encompass several strategies for evaluating and creating advertising. Evaluation was carried out using a questionnaire with both open-ended and Likert-type questions. Classroom observation protocols were also analyzed. The lesson plan proved to be very motivating and it initiated intense discussion about chemistry and science-related information in advertising. The findings of this study indicate that the lessons triggered self-reflection on students' consumer behavior. Most of the younger pupils saw advertising as a suitable and important topic for the science classroom. More advanced students tended to regard such issues as an interesting, but in some cases an unnecessary, part of their science education. Findings from the different groups are compared. Future research directions are also considered.\",\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Spartina alterniflora is one of the most hazardous invasive plant species in China. Monitoring the changes in dominant plant species can help identify the invasion mechanisms of S. alterniflora, thereby providing scientific guidelines on managing or controlling the spreading of this invasive species at Jiuduansha Wetland in Shanghai, China. However, because of the complex terrain and the inaccessibility of tidal wetlands, it is very difficult to conduct field experiments on a large scale in this wetland. Hence, remote sensing plays an important role in monitoring the dynamics of plant species and its distribution on both spatial and temporal scales. In this study, based on multi-spectral and high resolution (<10 m) remote sensing images and field observational data, we analyzed spectral characteristics of four dominant plant species at different green-up phenophases. Based on the difference in spectral characteristics, a decision tree classification was built for identifying the distribution of these plant species. The results indicated that the overall classification accuracy for plant species was 87.17%, and the Kappa Coefficient was 0.81, implying that our classification method could effectively identify the four plant species. We found that the area of Phragmites australi showed an increasing trend from 1997 to 2004 and from 2004 to 2012, with an annual spreading rate of 33.77% and 31.92%, respectively. The area of Scirpus mariqueter displayed an increasing trend from 1997 to 2004 (12.16% per year) and a decreasing trend from 2004 to 2012 (−7.05% per year).   S. alterniflora has the biggest area (3302.20 ha) as compared to other species, accounting for 51% of total vegetated area at the study region in 2012. It showed an increasing trend from 1997 to 2004 and from 2004 to 2012, with an annual spreading rate of 130.63% and 28.11%, respectively. As a result, the native species P. australi was surrounded and the habitats of S. mariqueter were occupied by S. alterniflora. The high proliferation ability and competitive advantage for S. alterniflora inhibited the growth of other plant species and we anticipate a continuous expansion of this invasive species at Jiuduansha Wetland. Effective measures should be taken to control the invasion of S. alterniflora.',\n",

For the treatment of epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and surgeries are widely used. However, drug resistance and adverse effects indicate the need to develop targeted AEDs based on further exploration of the epileptogenic mechanism. Currently, many efforts have been made to elucidate the neuroinflammation theory in epileptogenesis, which may show potential in the treatment of epilepsy. In this respect, an important target protein, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), has received increased attention and has been developed rapidly. HMGB1 is expressed in various eukaryotic cells and localized in the cell nucleus. When HMGB1 is released by injuries or diseases, it participates in inflammation. Recent studies suggest that HMGB1 via Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways can trigger inflammatory responses and play an important role in epilepsy. In addition, studies of HMGB1 have shown its potential in the treatment of epilepsy. Herein, the authors analyzed the experimental and clinical evidence of the HMGB1-TLR pathway in epilepsy to summarize the theory of epileptogenesis and provide insights into antiepileptic therapy in this novel field.',\n",

Psychological distress was assessed by the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), death anxiety was assessed by a single item scale designed by Abdel-Khalek, and perceived social support was assessed by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The research findings show that higher levels of death anxiety were associated with higher levels of psychological distress only among nurses with lower levels of perceived social support.

In the current study, we investigated whether combining motor imagery training with SRC tasks could enhance the scoring ability of lacrosse players.

All three groups performed a lacrosse shooting test and a Simon task before and after training sessions to assess the magnitude of the interference effects of the various types of training they underwent. The results of the Simon task showed that repetition of 1,000 trials was enough to create a short-term representation with the incompatible special mapping being transferred to a dynamic activity like lacrosse shooting.

Similar to all conditions associated with poorly regulated glucose metabolism, T1D carries an increased risk of infection. Consequently, careful compliance by T1D children with schedules officially approved for child immunization is strongly recommended. However, because patients with T1D show persistent and profound limitations in immune function, vaccines may evoke a less efficient immune response, with corresponding lower protection. Moreover, T1D is an autoimmune condition that develops in genetically susceptible individuals and some data regarding T1D triggering factors appear to indicate that infections, mainly those due to viruses, play a major role. Accordingly, the use of viral live attenuated vaccines is being debated. In this narrative review, we discussed the most effective and safe use of vaccines in patients at risk of or with overt T1D. Literature analysis showed that several problems related to the use of vaccines in children with T1D have not been completely resolved. There are few studies regarding the immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines in T1D children, and the need for different immunization schedules has not been precisely established. Fortunately, the previous presumed relationship between vaccine administration and T1D appears to have been debunked, though some doubts regarding rotavirus vaccines remain. Further studies are needed to completely resolve the problems related to vaccine administration in T1D patients. In the meantime, the use of vaccines remains extensively recommended in children with this disease.',\n",

We aimed to study the availability, perception, and future aspects of POCUS in the European HEMS using an online survey.   Method   A survey about the use of POCUS in HEMS was conducted by a multinational steering expert committee and was carried out from November 30, 2020 to December 30, 2020 via an online web portal. Invitations for participation were sent via email to the medical directors of the European HEMS organizations including two reminding notes.   Results   During the study period, 69 participants from 25 countries and 41 different HEMS providers took part in the survey. 96% (n = 66) completed the survey. POCUS was available in 75% (56% always when needed and 19% occasionally) of the responding HEMS organizations. 17% were planning to establish POCUS in the near future.

METHODS Data were collected from two ice hockey teams with differing performance levels. The higher-performance team consisted of 26 players (with ages of 16.3±0.9 y, heights of 178.26±6.71 cm, and weights of 74.3±9.6 kg). The lower-performance team consisted of 19 players (with ages of 16.2±1.8 y, heights of 176.11±9.81 cm, and weights of 68.7±13.9 kg). Each participant performed six unilateral stances under static conditions on a balance pad placed on a force platform and five bilateral stances under dynamic conditions using a wobble board placed on the force platform. RESULTS The higher-level players performed better in the unilateral static stance task in both the anterior-posterior direction and the medial-lateral direction (with a P value of P<0.001), and total velocity (P=0.001). The higher-level players also performed better in both the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions, and total velocity (with P value of P<0.001), in the bilateral dynamic stance task and therefore performed significantly better than the lower-level players. CONCLUSIONS Hockey players who possess a highly developed postural control strategy have a superior ability to compensate for unexpected postural disturbances and collisions, and thus possess a strong competitive advantage. Therefore, testing the balance abilities of hockey players under static and dynamic conditions may be useful for evaluating their competitive performance levels.',\n",

The eastern stretch of Ganga showed a variation of Water Quality Index (WQI) from 55 to 416 and Synthetic Pollution Index (SPI) from 0.59 to 3.68 in nine years.

Current study employed inter simple sequence repeats of DNA (ISSR markers) to assess genetic diversity within and among a single cultivated population maintained through sexual propagation (SR1) and four cultivated populations generated by artificial selection and maintained by vegetative propagation (SR2-SR5). Highest polymorphism rate was reported in SR1 (89.24%), whilst the lowest rate of polymorphism occurred in SR2 (60.13%). ISSR markers revealed that selection of plants with traits of vegetative-propagated interest may lead towards the generation of genetically more uniform DNA-level populations, while plants maintained by sexual propagation have high genetic variability. High estimated genetic divergence level indicated that the five areas of stevia form genetically structured populations. SR2 and SR4 are constituted by plants more homogeneous at DNA level for the selected characteristics than plants of SR3 and SR5 populations. Predominant and homogeneous genotypes selected at SR2 and SR4 areas could be valuable for tracing strategies to obtain stevia plants with the desirable agronomic characteristics through crosses between contrasting individuals in future breeding programs.',\n",

By analyzing serial block-face electron microscopy images of cryofixed antennal tissues, we compile an extensive morphometric data set based on 122 reconstructed 3D models for 33 of the 40 identified antennal ORN types. Additionally, we observe multiple novel features-including extracellular vacuoles within sensillum lumen, intricate dendritic branching, mitochondria enrichment in select ORNs, novel sensillum types, and empty sensilla containing no neurons-which raise new questions pertinent to cell biology and sensory neurobiology. Our systematic survey is critical for future investigations into how the size and shape of sensory neurons influence their responses, sensitivity, and circuit function.',\n",

The scope of this reaction was expanded to encompass alkynes with hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, ferrocenyl, alkynyl, azaborinyl and boronate ester substituents. Treatment of these complexes with PMe3 led to insertion of the rhodium atom into the B–C bond of the BNC2 ring, forming 1-rhoda-3,2-azaboroles. Addition of N-heterocyclic carbenes to azaborete complexes led to highly unusual rearrangements to rhodium η2,κ1-allenylborylamino complexes via deprotonation and C–N bond cleavage. Heating and photolysis of an azaborete complex also led to rupture of the C–N bond followed by subsequent rearrangements, yielding an η4-aminoborylallene complex and two isomeric η4-butadiene complexes.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Achilles tendon thickening (ATT) is a marker of high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the association between the presence of ATT and the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD is unclear. A total of 406 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and ATT assessment were analyzed. ATT was defined as the Achilles tendon thickness of 9\\xa0mm or more on radiography. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1-year was compared between patients with ATT and those without ATT. MACE included cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and non-TVR. ATT was found in 67 patients (16.5%). The incidence of cardiac death (3.2 vs. 0.0%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), TVR (12.7 vs. 4.0%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.005) and MACE (20.6 vs. 9.6%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.011) was significantly higher in the ATT group than the no ATT group. Patients with ATT had significantly higher incidence of cardiac death (5.6 vs. 0%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) than those without ATT even if they did not meet the diagnostic criteria of familial hypercholesterolemia. A multivariate model demonstrated that ATT was independently associated with the MACE at 1-year (Hazard ratio, 2.09; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.09–4.00, p\\u2009=\\u20090.026). The presence of ATT was independently associated with 1-year recurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD undergoing PCI. Assessment of ATT might be useful for risk stratification of secondary cardiovascular events.',\n",

This paper explains the issues of instability and losing unity power factor operation, i.e., high reactive power transfer with conventional PI compensator due to the sensitive variation of output impedance of the PFC stage at different loads. In this paper, this instability issue is resolved by the proposed state-feedback control methodology, which shows that there exists a load-insensitive range of controller parameters, providing unity PFC. As an additional benefit of this control, total number of sensors are reduced by three (an input phase current, a dc/dc primary current, and an output dc voltage), in comparison to the conventional PI-based control. This reduction is achieved by introducing two augmented state variables followed by their reduced state observer design. A 6-kW laboratory prototype of the integrated three-phase PFC and PSFB dc/dc is developed and designed to validate the proposed control algorithm. The experimental results show a conversion efficiency of 95.4% at full load, input total harmonic distortion of 4.1%, power factor of 0.998, and output voltage ripple of ±1%.',\n",
