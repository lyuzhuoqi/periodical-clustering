The objective of this study was to characterize the MMP-13 gene in channel catfish, and to determine its pattern of expression in various healthy tissues and during embryogenesis. Since MMP-13 has been shown to have importance in tissue remodelling and some pathological processes, we further studied its involvement in the defense responses of catfish after bacterial infection. The channel catfish MMP-13 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1416 bp encoding 471 amino acids. Using RT-PCR analysis, MMP-13 was widely expressed in various health tissues. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis, expression of MMP-13 gene was up-regulated by bacterial infection. During normal embryological development, MMP-13 expression was slightly increased in the first day post-fertilization and sharply up-regulated from 1-day post-fertilization through hatching.\"\n",

The algorithm utilizes the box-counting measure of the fractal dimension to determine the number of hypercubes required to encompass the aggregate, on a set of length scales, over which the structure can be defined as fractal. At each length scale the hypercubes required to generate the structure are chosen using a simple random walk which ensures connectivity of the aggregate. The algorithm is highly efficient and overcomes the limitations on the magnitude of the fractal dimension encountered by previous techniques.\"\n",

Compared to the O-phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues, our understanding of histidine phosphorylation is relatively limited, particularly in higher eukaryotes, due to technical difficulties stemming from the intrinsic instability and isomerism of phosphohistidine (pHis). We report the design and synthesis of stable and nonisomerizable pHis analogues. These pHis analogues were successfully utilized in solid-phase peptide synthesis and semi-synthesis of histone H4. Significantly, the first antibody that specifically recognizes pHis was obtained using the synthetic peptide as the immunogen.\"\n",

When each local government is free to create its own performance measurement system and select its own performance metrics, the result can be a 'Tower of Babel' that precludes valid benchmarking.

      "    \"abstract\": \"To determine the feasibility and efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastases from colorectal cancer (CRC). Total of 59 patients with 78 lesions confined to one organ and treated from 2001 to 2006 were involved in this retrospective review. These patients presented with 1-4 metastatic lesions of largest diameter of <7 cm, progressed after chemotherapy, and were amenable to local treatment. The median radiation dose administered was 42 Gy, which was delivered in 3 fractions. Lymph node lesions were most frequent, followed in order by the lung and liver. Five-year overall survival and local control rates were 29 and 19%, respectively. Cumulative gross tumor volume, site of metastasis, and SBRT dose were found to be significantly associated with overall survival. In terms of local control, a cumulative GTV below 23 ml was found to be a significantly favorable prognostic factor. Acute grade 1-2 toxicities occurred in 24 of the 59 patients, and a late grade 4 complication occurred in 2 (3%), and these were relieved by bypass surgery. CRC patients with oligometastases generally fare well after SBRT. In particular, the survival rates of patients with a pelvic LN or a small tumor are promising.\"\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Leptin can enhance thymopoiesis and modulate the T-cell immune response. However, it remains controversial whether these effects correlate with the expression of leptin receptor, ObR. We herein addressed this issue by using in vivo animal models and in vitro culture systems. Leptin treatment in both ob/ob mice and normal young mice induced increases of CD4 SP thymocytes in thymus and CD4 T cells in the periphery. Interestingly, expression of the long form ObR was significantly restricted to DN, DP and CD4 SP, but not CD8 SP thymocytes. Moreover, in the reaggregated DP thymocyte cultures with leptin plus TSCs, leptin profoundly induced differentiation of CD4 SP but not CD8 SP thymocytes, suggesting that the effects of leptin on thymocyte differentiation might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor in developing thymocytes. Surprisingly, ObR expression was markedly higher in peripheral CD4 T cells than that in CD8 T cells. Furthermore, leptin treatment with or without IL-2 and PHA had preferential effects on cell proliferation of CD4 T cells compared to that of CD8 T cells. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the effects of leptin on differentiation and proliferation of CD4 T cells might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor.\"\n",

The simplest such model, a complex Ginzburg-Landau model with cubic nonlinearity, has no stable solitonic solutions. We show that coupling it to a resonant linear system is a simple and general route to stabilization, which encompasses several previous instances in both space- and time-domains. Graphical solution in the complex eigenvalue plane provides valuable insight into the similarities and differences of such models, and into the interpretation of related experiments. It can also be used predictively, to guide analysis, numerics and experiment.\"\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Abstract     Small bioactive peptides, with diverse biological functions, have received increasing attention as physiologically beneficial substances in animal production. The main obstacle to wide application of small bioactive peptides is a lack of cost-effective methods for mass production. In this study, we used glycyl-glutamine (Gly-Gln) as a test case to develop a novel mass-production method for small bioactive peptides. The oligonucleotide encoding Gly-Gln pro-peptide (Gpp) was designed and synthesized. Gpp includes 3 Gly-Gln dipeptides and 2 enzymatic sites for pepsin and trypase, allowing direct digestion and absorption of Gly-Gln in the gastrointestinal tract. The Gpp oligonucleotides were linked to generate an oligomeric oligonucleotide segment containing 12 tandem copies of Gpp. This 12Gpp segment was cloned and expressed in   Escherichia coli   vector pET32a. By optimizing culture conditions [0.1 mmol L −1   isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 50 μg mL −1   ampicillin (Amp), 30°C for 12 h], the thioredoxin fusion peptides reached 40% of total bacterial protein. After purification, the fusion protein was fed to Kunming mice to determine its effect on mouse immune function. The results showed that similar to Gly-Gln dipeptide, Gpp polymer protein could significantly suppress the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes in blood and spleen, and additionally could significantly improve interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion of blood and spleen lymphocytes. These effects were not observed in mice fed a 2 amino acids mix (glycine and glutamine). These evidences indicated that an efficient digestion of Gpp polymer protein could be achieved when ingested into the animal gut. The expression system in this study provides a potential production method for not only Gly-Gln dipeptide but also other short bioactive peptides.\"\n",

Although markers for early diagnosis and drugs that limit the spread of cancer to other organs have been developed, it is difficult to prevent the relapse of breast cancer. Recent research has highlighted the importance of tumor environment in which communication between tumor cells and the body system occurs. Emerging data have suggested that animal models are a good system to investigate this communication. Therefore, studies with mouse models have been developed as a reasonable method for a systemic approach to understand breast cancer metastasis. In this review, we summarize mouse models of breast cancer and their applications to the study of human breast cancers, and discuss limitation of model system and advanced techniques to overcome it.\"\n",

A droplet that approached the surface was sensed using a photodetector and after a known delay, a light source was triggered to illuminate the particle in order to photograph it with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. A rapid two-color pyrometer was used to collect the thermal radiation from the particles to follow the evolution of their temperature and size, in-flight and after impact. The fully molten particles spread into a thin liquid splat after impacting the surfaces. The partially molten particles disintegrated into small satellite fragments immediately upon impact. The surface area, as indicated by the pyrometric signals, of the partially molten particles during spreading was almost an order of magnitude smaller than that of the fully molten droplets. The pyrometric signals of partially molten zirconia showed significant fluctuations, lower maximum voltages, and were wider than those of fully molten zirconia. These signals, characteristic of the impact of partially molten zirconia, provide a novel method of identifying partially molten ceramic particles after impact on a flat surface.\"\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We propose PWC, a proactive worm containment solution for enterprises. PWC can stop—instead of just slow down—an infected host from releasing worm scans as early as after merely four scans. Motivated by the observation that a worm uses a sustained outgoing packet rate, PWC gains infection awareness seconds before a signature or filter can be generated. To overcome denial-of-service possibly caused by such characteristic indicators of infection, PWC/,develops two new white detection (detecting who are uninfected) techniques: (a) the vulnerability time window lemma, and (b) the relaxation analysis. PWC does not rely on contents-based signatures thus it can defend against polymorphic worms timely in containment. PWC is also resilient to containment evading. PWC is not sensitive to worm scan rate, and not protocol specific. Due to white detection, PWC causes minimal denial-of-service. Evaluation based on real traces and worm simulations demonstrates that PWC significantly outperforms Virus Throttle in terms of number of released worm scans, number of hosts infected by local scans, and denial-of-service effects.

Effect of supplementing complex media (peptone, yeast extract, or tryptone) was investigated on the production of nattokinase. In flask culture, the highest cell growth and nattokinase activity were obtained with 50 g/L of peptone supplementation. In this condition, nattokinase activity was 630 unit/ml at 12 h. In batch culture of   B. subtilis   in fermentor, the highest nattokinase activity of 3400 unit/ml was obtained at 10 h with 50 g/L of peptone supplementation. From the batch kinetics data, it was shown that nattokinase production was growth-associated and culture should be harvested before stationary phase for maximum nattokinase production. In fed-batch culture of   B. subtilis   using pH-stat feeding strategy, cell growth (optical density monitored at 600 nm) increased to ca. 100 at 22 h, which was 2.5 times higher than that in batch culture.

      "    \"abstract\": \"The electric field in the neighborhood of the tip of conical point exhibits an integrable special feature. Therefore, for calculating the current of thermionic-field emission from a conical point, one has to find (or reasonably estimate) the emission current density, including that at high and, in the limit, infinite fields. It is suggested to solve this problem using, firstly, a numerical method of finding the electric field of a conical point which is capable of correctly describing the feature at the tip and, secondly, a common approach to considering the thermionic, field, and thermionic-field emission of electrons from metal in a wide range of variation of electric field on the surface. It is demonstrated that, at high electric fields, the density of thermionic-field emission current tends to some limiting value, i.e., the effect of saturation of emission current density is observed. The basic reason for this saturation is found. It is demonstrated that the total current of electron emission from a conical point remains finite at not too high values of intensity of external electric field, in spite of the infinite field increasing at the cone tip.\"\n",
